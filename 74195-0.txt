PREFACE.


The selections for the FOURTH PROGRESSIVE READER have been made with
great care, and, if the judgment of some of our most accomplished
teachers may be trusted, with becoming discrimination.

Lessons have been selected that are interesting to the young, and that
convey, each, an instructive moral in such a way as to impress itself
deeply on the mind of the pupil. They have also been selected and
arranged with a view to affording the best possible exercises in reading.

New selections have been made from several distinguished writers. Those
from Archbishop Spalding, Father Lacordaire, Doctor Newman, Miss Hoffman,
and Brother Philippe, are in every respect excellent.

Short biographical sketches have been appended of the different authors
from whose works selections, have been made. In making those selections
care has been taken to furnish examples of the various styles of
composition, and in doing this whatever could be found most interesting
and instructive was sought for; whilst every thing dull, frivolous, or
at all tinctured with erroneous views or principles has been rigidly
excluded.

The Lessons are a grade higher than those of the THIRD READER, but
nothing supposed to be above the capacity or intelligence of children who
have read through the preceding books of the Series has been introduced.

The instructions on articulation, emphasis, and inflection, will be found
to be moderately full and very clear and intelligible.

TABLE OF VOWEL SOUNDS.

This table is designed for an exercise upon the vowel elements. These
should be pronounced alone as well as in combination with the words given
as examples. Let the class first pronounce the table in order, thus:

A long, Fate, ā; A short, Fat, ă, &c.; then pronounce the column of
elements alone.

TABLE OF CONSONANT SOUNDS.

This table should be treated by the class in the same manner as the
table of vowel sounds. The sound of a consonant may be ascertained by
pronouncing a word containing it in a slow and forcible manner.

VOCAL CONSONANTS are those uttered with a slight degree of vocality, but
less than that of a vowel. They are formed with a vibration of the vocal
chords.

ASPIRATE CONSONANTS are those in which the pure breath alone is heard.
They are formed without any vibration of the vocal chords.

EXERCISES ON THE VOWEL SOUNDS.

In pronouncing the words in the following exercises, special attention
should be given to the precise sound of the letters italicized. The
sounds of the letters in Italics are the same as the sound of the vowel
at the head of the paragraph.

Exercises upon tables of words like the following are valuable, not only
for developing vocal power, but as one of the best methods of correcting
habitual errors in pronunciation.

INTRODUCTION.


It can not be too often, or too emphatically, impressed on the minds of
those who desire to read well, that they must study to acquire the same
easy, graceful, and natural tone and manner in reading, which persons
of education and taste use in speaking. It is important, therefore, to
observe closely the manner of those who read and speak well.

But, of course, no one can be taught to read well until he has learned
to articulate distinctly and pronounce his words correctly. He must also
pay due attention to TIME, INFLECTION and EMPHASIS. The following rules
and exercises, taken from the best sources, will be found very useful.
They are made as simple and plain as possible, but are at the same time
moderately full.


PRONUNCIATION.

Pronunciation is good when all the letters and syllables in every word,
are uttered with due force and proper fullness of sound. To pronunciation
belong _articulation_ and _accent_.

A correct _articulation_ requires that every vowel, and, of course,
every syllable in a word, be uttered with fulness and distinctness.

A correct _accentuation_ requires that a peculiar stress be laid on one
or more syllables of a word, and, of course, that the other syllables be
pronounced with less stress, or force. In most words it is sufficient to
accent one syllable. In monosyllables there can be no accent, as if _one_
syllable were pronounced with force, there would be _no_ syllable left to
be passed over lightly.

[See exercises on these and similar words in the author’s “Columbian
Spelling Book.”]

V. Avoid blending the end of a word with the beginning of the next. Do
not confound—

  False _sights_,                  ”   False _heights_.
  The darkest _hour_,              ”   The darkest _tower_.
  It strikes with an _awe_,        ”   It strikes with a _naw_.
  My heart was _awed_,             ”   My heart was _sawed_.
  A _notion_ of sweetness,         ”   An _ocean_ of sweetness.
  There was a great _error_,       ”   There was a great _terror_.
  My _brothers ought_ to go,       ”   My _brother sought_ to go.
  He walked in _fields of ice_,    ”   He walked in _fields of vice_.
  Wastes _and_ deserts,            ”   Waste _sand_ deserts.
  Look on this _spot_,             ”   Look on this _pot_.
  Goodness _centers_ in the heart, ”   Goodness _enters_ in the heart.
  Luxurious _soil_,                ”   Luxurious _oil_.
  Chaste _stars_,                  ”   Chased _tars_.
  Such a _notion_ exists,          ”   Such an _ocean_ exists.
  To obtain _either_,              ”   To obtain _neither_.
  His _cry_ moved me,              ”   His _crime_ moved me.
  The same _arrow_,                ”   The same _marrow_.


ACCENT.

The remarks on _Accentuation_ in the third book of this series have
already familiarized the learner with the uses of accent. He has learned
how accent determines the pronunciation of words, and how it shows, in
many cases, the sounds of the vowels. He has also learned, that many
words are differently accented, and, of course, differently pronounced,
when used as nouns, from the manner in which they are accented and
pronounced, when used as verbs.

We shall not repeat what we have there explained; but we will here
inform the pupil, that while all words of more than one syllable have
one accented syllable, almost all words of more than three syllables
have two accented syllables. These two syllables are not accented with
equal force, and this makes necessary the terms _Primary Accent_, and
_Secondary Accent_.

Where two syllables are accented in the same word, that which has the
greater amount of stress laid upon it, receives the primary accent
(generally marked ˝), and that which has the less amount of stress laid
upon it, receives the secondary accent (generally marked ˊ or ˋ).

EXAMPLES.

  edˊ-u-ca˝-tion
  recˊ-o-mend˝
  vo-cab˝-u-larˊ-y
  resˊ-o-lu˝-tion
  amˊ-bi-gu˝-i-ty
  adˊ-mon-i˝-tion
  tem˝-po-raˊ-ry
  mo˝-ment-aˊ-ry
  inˊ-de-pend˝-ence
  conˊ-ver-sa˝-tion
  satˊ-is-fac˝-tion
  mat˝-ri-moˊ-ny
  conˊ-se-quen˝-tial
  rĕˊ-sur-rec˝-tion
  morˊ-ti-fi-ca˝-tion

Observing the proper position of the accent, and paying particular
attention to it, is indispensable for good reading. Those who fail to
do so, always read with a drawling, monotonous tone, and cannot please
their hearers. There is no precision in their pronunciation, and there
can be no clearness in their enunciation. (See the “Columbian Spelling
Book,” page 105, where the nature and uses of accents are treated of at
considerable length.)


TIME.

The second requisite of good reading is, that due regard be paid to
TIME: if the reader hurries on without making the necessary pauses, the
pronunciation is not only indistinct, but the sense is often altogether
lost; and if he hesitates, making pauses where none should be made, and
reads without animation or spirit, the sense is equally injured, or made
difficult to ascertain, and the reading is of that drawling kind to which
it is so tiresome to listen.

Those who desire to become good readers, then, must pay due attention to
the pauses which should be made. Pauses are of two kinds, Grammatical
Pauses, which are marked by characters, and Rhetorical Pauses, which are
not marked by characters, but which the sense of what you read, requires
to be made. We shall first speak of the GRAMMATICAL PAUSES; they are—

  The Comma         (marked) ,
   ”  Semicolon        ”     ;
   ”  Colon            ”     :
   ”  Period           ”     .
   ”  Interrogation    ”     ?

The Parenthesis () is used to inclose some word or words which are not
essential to the structure of the sentence; and the Dash (—) is used to
denote a sudden breaking or turning off in the discourse or sentence.

When any of these points is met with in reading, there must be a pause of
greater or less duration. You should stop at the comma about as long as
you would be saying a word, or while you can draw breath; at the others
you should stop a little longer, but there can be no proper time fixed
upon; the sense and requirements of the sentence or clause must always
determine. It is usual to stop longer at each subsequent pause marked in
the table, than at the preceding one; thus, longer at the semicolon than
the comma, longer at the colon than the semicolon, and so on. This cannot
be given as an invariable rule, however, due attention to the sense of
the passage read being the best possible, indeed, the only way in which
the proper duration of the pause can be determined.

RHETORICAL PAUSES are such as the sense requires, though not marked by
characters. It will be at once perceived, that the proper making of them
is much more difficult to the young reader, than those of which we have
just spoken; and yet, if he desires to read with grace and elegance, he
cannot dispense with them. We do not think that very young learners will
be benefited much by studying rules for making rhetorical pauses, (they
can be made to understand their proper use and place more readily by a
competent teacher,) but we give a few of the most useful and simple.

  1. _The rhetorical pause should be made after the subject, or
  nominative, if it consists of several words_; as—To express this
  connection | two marks are used. The love of riches | is not a
  virtue. The experience of want | enhances the value of plenty.

  2. _When the subject is an important word there should be a
  rhetorical pause made after it_; as—Charity | like the sun |
  brightens all its objects. Industry | is the foundation of
  wealth. God | hath set him over us. Truth | never changes.

  3. _The rhetorical pause should be made before and after clauses
  and similes_; as—The hope | which we have | as an anchor of the
  soul. And calm | as a slumber | they die. Hope | the balm of life
  | hath soothed us. Virtue | like gold | bears to be tried.

  4. _The rhetorical pause should be made after the objective in
  sentences of inverted construction_; as—To my mother | give my
  fond remembrance. On all sides | were carnage and death. On
  Linden | when the sun was low. On this side of the grave | there
  is no real happiness.

  5. _A pause should generally be made before the relative
  pronoun_; as—He | who fears God | may be trusted. I have faith |
  that I may have life. I saw a man | who begged his bread. Nobody
  loves him | who loves only himself. She gave me this book | which
  I now hand to you.

  6. _A pause should generally be made before and after clauses
  introduced by prepositions_; as—It is below me | on his throne |
  to sit. Work | without show | and without pomp | presides. They
  spoke to me | of things | which I had seen | and of things |
  which I had not seen. From law | arises security.

  7. _A pause should be made before many of the conjunctions and
  adverbs_; as—Honor | and shame | from no condition rise. I fought
  not for | but against Cæsar. Hast so much wit | and mirth | and
  spleen about thee. I stood among them | not of them. The region
  | beyond the grave | is not a solitary land. I shall come |
  whenever I can. Take heed | lest ye fall. Watch | and pray | lest
  ye enter into temptation. Though he was learned | yet he was
  modest.


EMPHASIS.

Emphasis is a peculiar stress laid on words for the purpose of
distinguishing them _from_, or contrasting them _with_ other words; also
for the purpose of drawing marked attention to any particular word.

EXAMPLES.

  1. I spoke not _for_ | but _against_ Cæsar.

  2. I did not say _here_ | but _there_.

  3. You say | he is _honest_. There is not | a more _dishonest_
  man | in town.

  4. I care not | who is _in_ | or | who is _out_.

  5. We have offended against the lord | _already_.

  6. He | who cannot _bear_ a joke | should not _give_ a joke.

  7. _Little_ minds | are _crushed_ by misfortune, when _great_
  ones | _rise above_ it. _He_ raised a _mortal to_ the skies, |
  _she_ drew an _angel down_.

  8. Many mistake _love_ of virtue | for _virtue_.

Emphasis is sometimes laid only on particular syllables of a word; as—

  1. What is _said_ | cannot be _un_said.

  2. He will _decrease_ | but I will _in_crease.

  3. There is seldom _convenience_ | without _in_convenience.

  4. To _do_ | and to _un_do | are common things.

Emphasis is _slight_, _strong_, and _vehement_; as—

  1. Let our motto be | _our country_, our WHOLE COUNTRY, and |
  NOTHING BUT OUR COUNTRY.

  2. My first argument | is, that _the people_ | _demand it_; my
  second argument | is, that THE PEOPLE | DEMAND IT; my third
  argument | is, that THE PEOPLE | DEMAND IT.

  3. If I was an American | as I am an Englishman, I would _never_
  lay down my arms—_never_, NEVER, NEVER.

  4. The _union_, it SHALL | and MUST be _preserved_.

  5. RISE | _arch of the ocean_, and _queen of the west_!

  6. _Romeo_, ROMEO, _wherefore_ art thou _Romeo_?

The following admirable observations on EMPHASIS are worthy of attention.

“In every sentence, and clause of a sentence, there is one or more words
which require to be pronounced with a greater degree of force than
the other words. Without knowing and marking the _accented_ syllables
in words, we cannot give them their proper pronunciation; nor can we
bring out the full meaning of a sentence, unless we know and mark the
_emphatic_ words. The accented syllables of words we learn by imitating
the pronunciation of correct speakers; and by referring, in cases of
doubt, to a dictionary in which they are given. The emphatic words in a
sentence we can only learn by knowing their relative importance in it,
and the precise meaning which the writer of it intended each of them to
convey. In fact, if we know the meaning and drift of the sentence, we
shall have no difficulty in discovering the emphatic words. In all such
cases they are naturally and spontaneously suggested to us, just as they
are to persons uttering or speaking their own sentiments. For even the
most illiterate persons are sure, when uttering their own sentiments,
to lay the proper emphasis on their words; though they may, and very
often do, give them the wrong _accents_. If a laboring man, for example,
were to say, “It is a spade, and not a shovel that I want,” he would
be sure to pronounce the words “_spade_” and “_shovel_” with a greater
degree of force than the other words; because he wishes to draw the
particular attention of the person whom he addresses to the _ideas_ or
things which they represent. Had he merely said, “It is a spade I want,”
he would nevertheless have pronounced the word “_spade_” emphatically,
because he wished it to be particularly understood that it was a _spade_,
and not any other implement, such as a shovel, that he wanted. Should
he say, “Is the spade broken?” he would pronounce the word “_broken_”
emphatically; because his object is to obtain precise information on
that point. But if he should say, “Is it the spade that is broken?” he
will lay the emphasis on the word “_spade_,” and not upon “_broken_;”
because, understanding that there is some implement broken, he wishes
to be informed whether it is the _spade_. Again, should he say, “Is it
my spade that is broken?” he will lay the emphasis on the word “_my_”;
because he desires to know whether the spade that is broken is _his_ or
not. Should he ask, “Who broke the spade?” he will lay the emphasis on
the word “_who_;” because, being already aware that the spade is broken,
his object in making the inquiry is, to learn the name of the person who
broke it. And, lastly should he say, “How was the spade broken?” he will
make “_how_” the emphatic word; because, in this case, he wishes to be
informed of the manner or way in which the accident occurred.

“It is obvious from what has been said, that if we understand the meaning
of what we read, in the same degree as a person understands the thoughts
which he utters, we shall, like him, naturally and spontaneously lay the
_emphasis_ on the proper words. It is equally obvious, that if we do not
understand the meaning of what we read, we shall either have to pronounce
all the words with the same degree of force—which would be absurd—or
to run the risk of perverting the meaning of the author, by laying the
emphasis on the wrong words. The following sentence will exemplify
this:—“O fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have
written concerning me.” If we perceive that the intention of our Saviour
was to reproach his disciples for their _backwardness_ in believing, we
shall, in reading it, naturally lay the principal emphasis on the word
“_slow_.” But if we do not see that this was the object of the speaker,
the chances are we shall lay the emphasis on one of the other words, and
thus change or pervert the meaning. For example, if we lay the emphasis
on “_believe_,” it would imply that the disciples were reproached for
_believing_; if on “_all_,” then the inference would be that they might
have believed _some_ of the things which the prophets had written, but
that it was foolish in them to believe _all_. If we lay the emphasis on
“_prophets_,” it would imply that they might have believed _others_, but
that they were fools for believing the _prophets_; if on “_written_,”
the inference would be, that though they might have believed what the
prophets had _said_, it was foolish in them to believe what they had
_written_; and, finally, if we lay the emphasis on “_me_,” it would
imply that though they might have believed what the prophets had written
concerning _others_, yet they were fools for believing what they had
written concerning the _Saviour_.

Even in the most familiar sentences, illustrations of this may be found.
The simple question, for example: “Do you ride to town to-day?” may,
by varying the position of the emphasis, be made to suggest as many
different meanings as it contains words. If we lay the emphasis on
“_you_,” we wish to ascertain from the person addressed, whether it is
he or some other person that is to ride to town to-day; if on “_ride_,”
we mean to ask him whether he purposes to ride or walk; if on “_town_,”
our purpose is to inquire whether it is to the town or to the country he
means to ride; and, finally, if we make “_to-day_” the emphatic word, we
wish him to say whether it is to-day or to-morrow he intends to ride to
town. Even the preposition “_to_,” if made emphatic, would imply, though
obscurely, that we wished the person addressed to say whether he intended
to ride quite as far as the town, or only part of the way.

“We shall show, by a few illustrations, the power which EMPHASIS has over
accent when the sense or meaning requires it:—

  1. He must _in_crease, but I must _de_crease.

  2. Neither justice nor _in_justice has any thing to do with the
  matter.

  3. What is done cannot be _un_done.

  4. Religion raises men above themselves, _ir_religion sinks them
  below the brutes.

  5. This corruptible must put on _in_corruption, and this mortal
  must put on _im_mortality.

  6. To me it was far from being an agreeable surprise; on the
  contrary, it was a _dis_agreeable one.

  7. Thought and language act and _re_act upon each other.

  8. What fellowship hath righteousness with _un_righteousness? and
  what communion hath light with darkness?

  9. I shall always make nature, truth, and reason, the measures of
  praise and _dis_praise.

  10. A gentleman who was pressed by his friends to forgive his
  daughter, who had married against his wishes, promised to do so,
  but added, that he would have them remember that there was a
  difference between giving and _for_giving.

“In the preceding, and in all similar cases, the position of the _accent_
is completely changed by the _emphasis_. The reason is obvious: the
speaker wishes to draw the special attention of the person addressed to
the contrasted parts of the words; and hence he pronounces those parts
or syllables _emphatically_, the effect of which is, in such cases, to
change the seat of the accent.

“This transposition of the accent takes place also in words which have a
sameness of termination, even though they may not be directly opposed in
sense; as in the following examples:—

  1. Cataline was expert in all the arts of _sim_ulation and
  _dis_simulation; covetous of what belonged to others, lavish of
  his own.

  2. In this species of composition, _plaus_ibility is more
  essential than _prob_ability.

“From what has been said with regard to emphasis, we may draw the
following general conclusion: Whenever a person wishes to bring an _idea_
prominently or forcibly under the notice of the person or persons whom
he addresses, he will naturally and instinctively pronounce the _word_
which expresses it with a corresponding degree of _emphatic_ force.
The degree or intensity of the emphasis will, of course, depend upon
the importance of the idea to be expressed, the nature of the subject,
and the feelings or emotions of the speaker. In some cases it will be
_slight_, in others _strong_, and in others, _vehement_ or energetic; and
hence a good general division of emphasis, with regard to its intensity,
might be into three degrees, namely SLIGHT, STRONG, and VEHEMENT. Of
course, there must be a great diversity in the degrees of emphasis, from
the _slight_ to the _vehement_; but the general divisions which we have
suggested will be quite sufficient for practical purposes—and we have no
other in view.

“Though in all properly constructed sentences, every word is useful
and necessary, yet in every sentence the relative importance of the
words must be different. _Articles_, _Prepositions_, _Conjunctions_,
and _Auxiliary_ Verbs, for example, are less important in their
significations than the words which they introduce or connect—as _Nouns_,
_Verbs_, _Adjectives_, and _Adverbs_. And hence it may be laid down as
a general rule, that _the less important words in a sentence should be
pronounced with less of force and distinctness than the more important
words_. And this, as we have seen, we always do in SPEAKING; for it is
to the more important words that we naturally desire to draw the special
attention of the person or persons whom we address, and not to the
ancillary or subordinate words.

“It may also be observed that _Pronouns_, though important parts of
speech, should be classed, with regard to their pronunciation in a
sentence, with the less important words, as _Articles_, _Prepositions_,
and _Conjunctions_. The reason is obvious: no new idea is introduced by a
_Pronoun_. It stands for, or represents, a word which has been mentioned
before, and which is, consequently, already before the mind of the person
addressed. _Pronouns_, therefore, should be always pronounced without
emphasis, unless when some contrast or opposition is intended.[3] We
shall illustrate this by a familiar sentence or two:—

  If John is there, I will thank yŏu to give hĭm this book—though,
  perhaps, I should give it to _you_, and not to _him_. Yŏu are
  right; it is to _me_ you should give it. _You_ think so, but _I_
  think differently; and so, I am sure, does _he_.

“In the foregoing sentences, the pronouns printed in _Italic_ are
emphatical, because they are _antithetical_, or opposed to each other;
while the other pronouns in the same sentence should be pronounced
without emphasis, because no contrast or opposition is intended.

“In the same way, any of the less important parts of speech may become
emphatical; as—

  I told you to bring me _the_ book, not _a_ book. You were told
  to put the book _on_ the table—not _under_ it. It was _and_ I
  said—not _or_.

“From what has been said with regard to emphasis, it is evident that all
_antithetic_ or contrasted words are emphatic; and in fact, it is usual
to consider such words only as emphatic. Mr. Walker, and his followers,
for example, hold that in every case of emphasis there is an antithesis
expressed or implied; and that it never can be proper to give emphatic
force to a word unless it stands opposed in sense to some other word
expressed or understood.[4] But this is to take too narrow a view of
emphasis. There are other sources of it besides contrast or antithetic
relation. There may be _absolute_, as well as _antithetic_ emphasis. For
example, if the _idea_ to be communicated is of peculiar or paramount
importance in itself, the word expressing it should be pronounced with
a corresponding degree of emphatic force; and this a person speaking
his own sentiments will naturally do, particularly if he is under the
influence of passion or emotion. It is evident, too, that this kind of
emphasis may extend to _several words in succession_, and even to _whole
clauses of sentences_. This kind of emphasis Mr. Walker himself admits
under the head of “_General Emphasis_.” The following are examples:—

  1.                    What men could do
  Is done already: heaven and earth will witness,
  _If Rome must fall_, that we are innocent.

  2. There was a time, then, my fellow citizens, when the
  Lacedæmonians were sovereign masters both by sea and land; when
  their troops and forts surrounded the entire circuit of Attica;
  when they possessed Eubœa, Tanagra, the whole Bœotian district,
  Megara, Ægina, Cleone, and other islands; while this state had
  not one ship—no, _not—one—wall_.

  3. Or shall I—who was born I might almost say, but certainly
  brought up, in the tent of my father—that most excellent
  general!—shall I the conqueror of Spain and Gaul, and
  not only of the Alpine nations, but what is greater yet,
  of the Alps themselves—shall I compare myself with this
  _half-year-captain_,—a captain—before whom, should one place the
  two armies without their ensigns, I am persuaded he would not
  know to which of them he is consul.

“It is usual to subdivide _Antithetic Emphasis_ into Single, Double, and
Treble Emphasis;[5] and to give rules for the proper pronunciation of
_emphatic_ words in each case. But the simple principles we have adopted
render all such rules superfluous; for in all cases of antithesis the
antithetic terms must be either expressed or understood; if they are
expressed, which is usually the case, there can be no difficulty with
regard to emphasis; for when the words which are opposed to each other
in the sentence are expressed in it, the mind instantly perceives the
opposition between them and the voice instinctively marks it in the
pronunciation. The following are examples:—

SINGLE EMPHASIS.

  1. Study not so much to _show_ knowledge as to _acquire_ it.

  2. He that cannot _bear_ a jest should not _make_ one.

  3. We think less of the injuries we _do_, than of those we
  _suffer_.

  4. It is not so easy to _hide_ one’s faults, as to _mend_ them.

  5. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our _stars_,
     But in _ourselves_, that we are underlings.

DOUBLE EMPHASIS.

  1. To _err_ is _human_; to _forgive_, _divine_.

  2. Custom is the _plague_ of _wise_ men, and the _idol_ of
  _fools_.

  3. The _prodigal_ robs his _heir_, the _miser_ robs _himself_.

  4. The pleasures of the imagination are not so _gross_ as those
  of _sense_, nor so _refined_ as those of the _understanding_.

  5. Grief is the counter passion of joy. The _one_ arises from
  _agreeable_, and the _other_ from _disagreeable_ events—the _one_
  from _pleasure_, and the _other_ from _pain_—the _one_ from
  _good_, and the _other_ from _evil_.

  6. _One_ sun by _day_—by _night_ _ten thousand_ shine.

  7. The foulest stain and scandal of our nature
     Became its boast—_one_ murder makes a _villain_,
     _Millions_ a _hero_.

TREBLE EMPHASIS.

  1. _He_ raised a _mortal_ to the _skies_,
     _She_ drew an _angel_ _down_.

  2. A _friend_ cannot be _known_ in _prosperity_; and an _enemy_
  cannot be _hidden_ in _adversity_.

  3. The difference between a madman and a fool, is that the
  _former_ reasons _justly_ from _false_ data; and the _latter_
  _erroneously_ from _just_ data.

  4. Flowers of rhetoric in sermons or serious discourses are like
  the blue and red flowers in corn, _pleasing_ to _those_ who come
  only for _amusement_, but _prejudicial_ to _him_ who would reap
  the _profit_.

  5. Had you rather Cæsar were _living_, and _die_ all _slaves_,
     Than that Cæsar were _dead_, to _live_ all _freemen_?

“In such cases as the preceding, it is obvious that there can be no
difficulty with regard to EMPHASIS; because the words which are opposed
to each other in the sentence are expressed. But when only one of the
contrasted terms is expressed, as in the following examples, the careless
or injudicious reader is apt to overlook its _antithetic_ import, and
will consequently fail to give it the emphatic pronunciation which is
necessary to bring out the full meaning of the sentence.

  1. A _child_ might understand it. [The antithesis implied or
  suggested in this sentence is obviously—not merely a _man_ or a
  person of _mature_ judgment, but even a _child_.]

  2. Exercise and temperance will strengthen even an _indifferent_
  constitution. [That is, not merely an _ordinary_ or _good_
  constitution, but even an _indifferent_ one.]

  3. _He_ that _runs_ may read. [That is, not merely a person who
  walks, and who has therefore leisure to observe, but even _he_
  that runs.]

  4. We know the passions of men: we know how dangerous it is to
  trust the _best_ of men with too much power. [That is, not merely
  _bad_ or _ordinary_ men, but even the _best_ of men.]

  5. _Tubal._ One of them showed me a ring which he had of your
  daughter for a monkey.

  _Shylock._ Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my
  turquoise,—I would not have given it for a _wilderness_ of
  monkeys. [That is, so far from giving it for _one_ monkey, I
  would not have given it for a _whole wilderness_ of monkeys.]

  6.          Can a _Roman_ senate long debate
  Which of the two to choose, slavery or death!

  [That is, _other_ senates may, but can a _Roman_ one?]

  7. Curse not the king, no, not in thy _thought_. [That is, not
  merely in _words_ or _audibly_, but even in thy _thought_.]

  8. And think not to say among yourselves, We have Abraham to our
  father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these _stones_
  to raise up children unto Abraham. [That is, not merely from the
  _seed_ or _descendants_ of Abraham, but even from these _stones_.]

  9. By the faculty of a lively and picturesque imagination, a man
  in a _dungeon_ is capable of entertaining himself with scenes
  and landscapes, more beautiful than any that can be found in the
  whole compass of nature. [That is, not only when he is _absent_
  from beautiful scenes, but even in a _dungeon_.]

  10. A man of a polite imagination is let in to a great many
  pleasures that the vulgar are not capable of receiving; he can
  converse with a _picture_, and find an agreeable companion in
  a _statue_. [That is, he can converse even with a _picture_,
  and find an agreeable companion even in a _statue_, which are
  pleasures unknown to the vulgar or uneducated.]

“It is obvious, that in each of the preceding examples there is an
antithesis implied or understood; and the only rule necessary in such
cases is, to pronounce the words which imply it with such a degree of
emphatic force as will best bring out the full meaning of the sentence.
And this every reader will naturally do, if he keeps in mind, and puts
into practice, the great and fundamental rule for GOOD READING, namely,
_Understand what you read, and read it as if you understood it._”


INFLECTION.

In speaking or reading, the voice must either rise or fall, if it do not
continue in the same uniform tone. This rising and falling, or upward and
downward sliding of the voice, is called INFLECTION.

When the voice rises, it is, of course, called the _rising inflection_,
and when it falls, the _falling inflection_.

When the voice, instead of either rising or falling, continues during the
utterance of several words in the same tone, it is called a _monotone_.
That falling of the tone which usually takes place at the end of a
sentence or paragraph is termed a _cadence_.

The voice sometimes rises and falls, or falls and rises, on the same word
or syllable. This is called a _circumflex_.

The inflections are generally marked thus:

  Rising Inflection,   (ˊ)
  Falling Inflection,  (ˋ)
  Cadence,             (ˋ)
  Circumflex,          (ˇ)

The following rules will assist the learner in determining the
inflections. They are as few and as simple as possible, and can be
understood with very little effort, particularly by the aid of a
competent teacher.

I. Whenever the voice must be suspended without the sense being complete,
the _rising inflection_ should be used.

EXAMPLES.

  1. No man can rise above the infirmities of naˊture, unless he is
  assisˊted by God.ˋ

  2. To acquire knowˊledge is the duty of man.

  3. Shame being lostˊ, all virtue is lost.

  4. Fathˊers, Senators of Romeˊ, arbiters of naˊtions, to you I
  fly for refuge.

  5. Poor were the expectations of the modˊest, the virˊtuousˊ, and
  the goodˊ, if the reward of their labors were expected only from
  man.

  6. An honest manˊ, (as the poet has saidˊ,) is the noblest work
  of God.

II. At the end of a sentence, and in all places where the sense is
complete, the _falling inflection_ should be used.

EXAMPLES.

  1. Peace will soon be estabˋlished; confidence will come with
  peaceˋ; capˋital will follow conˋfidence; employment will
  increase with capˋital; educationˊ will be diffuˊsed, and virtue
  will grow with educaˋtion.

  2. It is of the last importance to season the passions of a child
  with devoˋtion; which seldom dies in a mind that has received an
  early tincˋture of it.

  3. Temˊperance, by fortifying the mind and bodˊy, leads to
  hapˋpiness.

  4. Sincerity is to speak as we thinkˋ, to do as we pretend and
  professˋ, to perform and make good what we promˋise, and really
  to be what we appearˋ to be.

  5. The consequences of intemperance are disgraceˋ, povˋerty,
  disease, and premature deathˋ.

  6. I could not treat a dogˋ ill. Unkindness seldom produces other
  than evil effectsˋ.

III. When a question is asked by an interrogative word, the word which
asks the question, as well as all other important words in the question,
takes the _falling inflection_.

EXAMPLES.

  1. Whatˋ will you do in the day of visitaˋtion?

  2. Whereˋby shall I knowˋ this? Howˋ shall the manifestaˋtion be
  madeˋ?

  3. Whoˋ do men say that I amˋ? Whomˋ do they represent me to beˋ?

  4. Whoˋ is here so braveˋ that he would be a bondˋman?

  5. Whatˋ have I doneˋ that you should give me this cruel
  treatmentˋ?

  6. Whyˋ bendest thou in stormˋ; whyˋ lower thy headˋ?

IV. When a question is asked commencing with a verb, the previous rule is
reversed, and all the important words in the question, particularly the
last, take the _rising inflection_.

EXAMPLES.

  1. Is the windˊ blowˊing? Is the sunˊ shinˊing? Is it rainˊing?
  Is it snowˊing?

  2. Do I loveˊ? dost thou loveˊ? do we loveˊ?

  3. Are you coldˊ? Is he poorˊ? Is she vainˊ?

  4. Has he not involˊved himself by his improvˊidence?

  5. Has that poorˊ man been cheatˊed? has his povˊerty been no
  protecˊtion?

EXCEPTION.—_When the question defies contradiction, and is only
interrogatory in form, being really an assertion, the falling inflection
is used: as—_

  6. Are not the happy rareˋ? Are not the good the most hapˋpy?

  7. Does he not possessˋ this world’s goodsˋ as if he possessed
  them notˋ?

  8. How fewˋ can we find whose activˋity has not been misappliedˋ?

V.—Words that are contrasted with one another have opposite inflections;
and answers have, generally, opposite inflections to the questions.

EXAMPLES.

  1. We see the moteˋ in anothˊer’s eye, but cannot discern the
  beamˊ in our ownˋ.

  2. He strikes othˊers but hurts himselfˋ.

  3. We should judge by the heartˋ rather than the headˊ.

  4. Did he act justˋly or unjustˊly? He acted justˊly, not
  unjustˋly.

  5. Did he say trueˋ or untrueˊ. He said trueˊ, not untrueˋ.

  6. I am more inclined to be gladˋ than sorˊry, to loveˋ than
  to hateˊ, to make friendsˋ than to deserve foesˊ, to be a good
  friendˊ than a bad enemyˋ.

VI.—When words express pity, joy, or grief, they take the _rising
inflection_; and in all language expressive of tender emotion the _rising
inflection_ predominates.

EXAMPLES.

  1. Ohˊ dearˊ me. Oh genˊtle sleepˊ, nature’s soft nurseˊ.

  2. Piˊty, kindˊ gentlemen, friendsˊ of humanityˊ.

  3. Ohˊ, my lordˊ, let me speak a word in thy earˊ.

  4. I am thy fathˊer—oh, my sonˊ! my sonˊ!

  5. Poor Maˊry. How my heartˊ bled to see her angˊuish, when she
  looked upon her departed childˊ.

  6. Ohˊ that I knewˊ how I could consoleˊ her, how I could bring
  peaceˊ to her mind.ˋ

VII.—When words express denunciation, reproach, violent passion, or
dignified emotion, they take the falling inflection.

EXAMPLES.

  1. You wrong me evˋery way—you wrongˋ me, Brutus.

  2. Revengeˋ, _revengeˋ_, Timotheus cries.

  3. Let no man dareˋ speak ill of my departed fatherˋ.

  4. Oh wretched manˋ. Oh unhapˋpy sinner.

  5. Wretchˋ that I amˋ, whereˋ shall I goˋ?

  6. Avauntˋ and quit my sightˋ. Let the earth hideˋ thee. Begoneˋ!

  7. What a splendid piece of workˋmanship is manˋ.

  8. Behold the child of purˋity arrayed in her inˋnocence.

  9. Oh, dearˋest to my soulˋ—now goneˋ, alasˋ, from my sight. Woeˋ
  is me, that my sojourning is prolongˋed.

VIII.—In a commencing series, of three or four numbers, the last number
or numbers of the series, and in a concluding series, the last but one,
generally takes the _rising inflection_, and all the other take the
_falling inflection_.

EXAMPLES.

  1. Honorˋ, virˋtue, and truthˊ, distinguish himˋ.

  2. He is distinguished by honˋor, virˊtue, and truthˋ.

  3. Haˋtreds, dissenˋtions, disˋcords, and warsˊ are produced by
  ambiˋtion.

  4. You have a friend who will pityˋ, supportˋ, defendˊ, and
  relieveˋ you.

  5. The wind and rain are oˋver; calm is the morn of dayˋ; the
  clouds are divided in heavˊen; over the green hills flies the
  inconstant sunˋ.

  6. A true friend unbosoms freeˋly, advises justˋly, assists
  readˋily, takes all paˊtiently, and continues a friend
  unchangeˋably.

  7. A good disposiˋtion, virtuous princiˋples, a liberal
  educaˋtion, and industrious habˊits, are passports to happiness
  and honˋor.

  8. Hapˋpiness and honorˊ are the reward of a good disˋposition,
  virtuous prinˋciples, a liberal educaˊtion, and industrious
  habˋits.

  9. If you look about youˊ, and consider the lives of othˊers as
  well as your ownˋ; if you think how few are bornˋ with honˊor,
  and how many dieˊ without nameˊ or childˋren; how little beautyˋ
  we seeˊ, and how few friendsˊ we hearˋ of; how many diseasesˊ
  and how much povˋerty there is in the worldˊ, you will admireˊ,
  instead of repinˋing at God’s provˋidence.


CIRCUMFLEX INFLECTION.

In a circumflex the voice is made to bend so that it falls and rises,
or rises and falls, during the utterance of a single sound. Circumflex
inflection is used in expression of bitter irony or reproach.

EXAMPLES.

  1. They offer us their protecˋtion. Yĕs, sŭch protection as
  vŭltures give to lămbs—covering and devouring themˋ.

  2. Gone to be mărried! gone to swĕar a pĕace! gone to be frĭends!

  3. He dâres not touch a hâir of Catalineˋ.

  4. I may do what I shall be sorˋry for. You hâve done what you
  shoûld be sorˋry for.

  5. So this is yŏu. How glăd I am to meet so trŭe a friend.


MONOTONE.

In a monotone the voice neither rises nor falls during the utterance of a
succession of words. It is generally used in pronouncing grand and solemn
passages.

EXAMPLES.

1. _The bell strikes one._ We _take no note of time but from its loss.
To give it_, then, _a tongue is wise in man. As if an angel spoke, I
feel the solemn sound. If heard aright, it_ is the _knell of my departed
hours_.

2.

  Who would fardells bear,
  To groan and sweat under a weary life,
  _But that the dread of something after death_
  _That undiscovered country from whose bourne_
  _No traveler returns_,—puzzles the will
  And makes us _rather bear the ills we have_
  Than _fly to others which we know not of_.

3. I flew towards her; my arms were already unclosed to clasp her, when,
suddenly, _her figure changed—her face grew pale—a stream of blood gushed
from her bosom. ’Twas Evelina._

4.

  The _cloud-capped towers_, the _gorgeous palaces_,
  The _solemn temples_, the great globeˊ itselfˋ—
  Yea, _all which it inherit shall dissolve_,
  And, _like the baseless fabric of a vision_,
  Leaveˊ not a wreck behindˋ.


PARENTHESIS AND PARENTHETICAL CLAUSES.

A parenthesis is an explanatory clause introduced into a sentence.
Parenthesis might be omitted in reading without injuring the grammatical
construction of the sentence. The tone employed in reading parenthetical
clauses, should, generally, be lower than that in which the other parts
of the sentence are read. The monotone is most suitable for parenthesis,
but when inflections are used, as they sometimes are in short clauses,
the inflection should be the same as that used at the pause immediately
preceding the parenthesis, which is generally the _rising inflection_.

EXAMPLES.

  1. Rememˊber (continued she with a sighˊ) your dearˊ absent
  friendˋ.

  2. Know then, this truthˊ, (enough for man to knowˊ,)
     Virtue aloneˋ is happiness belowˋ.

  3. Nothing can be greatˊ the contemplation of which is not greatˋ
  (says Longinusˋ).

  4. On the one handˊ, are the divine approbaˊtion and immorˋtal
  honˋor; on the othˊer, (remember and bewareˊ,) are the stings of
  conˋscience and endless inˋfamy.

  5. Genˊtlemen, if I make out this case by evˊidence, (and if I
  do not, forget every thing you have heard, and reproach me for
  having abused your honest feelˊings,) I have established a claim
  for damˊages that has no parallel in the annals of fashionable
  intrigueˋ.

The expressions _said I_, _continued he_, _so to speak_, _then_,
_except_, _nevertheless_, _therefore_, _yet_, _notwithstanding_, etc.,
are read in a lower tone, like parenthesis, and with the _falling
inflection_, as:

  Justice, _said heˋ_, will carry it.
  Though he was rich, _yetˋ_, for our sakes he became poor.
  Though deep, _yet clearˋ_; though gentle, _yetˋ_ not dull.
  I love every one of them, _exceptˋ_ the old crone.
  He was, _so to speakˋ_, the lion of the tribe.


TONE.

Tone differs from accent and emphasis, but may be said to be nearly
allied to inflection. Tone is not confined to words, but to whole
passages, and is intended to convey to the minds of the hearers the
passions and feelings which are supposed to have influenced the writer or
speaker.

Nothing can contribute more to beautiful and expressive reading than the
use of the tones most suitable to the matter read. Nor is the correct
language of emotion, the appropriate sound with which certain passages
should be uttered, of very difficult attainment. The smallest child
finds tones to express its various feelings, and there can be no great
difficulty in the reader’s ascertaining the emotions under which the
author spoke or wrote, and making his tones such as give best expression
to those emotions.

But in this, as in other matters, there should be moderation. Every thing
artificial and theatrical should, in reading ordinary compositions, be
avoided. We recommend Murray’s rule to the learner: “In reading, let your
tones of expression be borrowed from those of common speech, but, in some
degree, more faintly characterized. Let those tones which signify any
disagreeable passion of the mind be more faint than those which indicate
agreeable emotion; and, on all occasions, preserve yourselves from being
so far affected with the subject as to be able to proceed through it with
an easy and masterly manner, which has its good effects in this as well
as in every other art.”


EXPRESSION AND ENERGY.

The following observations on Expression and Energy are taken from
Vandenhoff’s “Plain System of Elocution:”


EXPRESSION.

“Expression is the modulating or regulating the organ of the voice to
tones of gentleness or force, according to the nature and degree of
feeling, or passion, expressed in words. Expression is the natural
language of emotion. It is, in Elocution, to a certain extent, a vocal
imitation of passion. But this must be done without “aggravating the
voice” (as Bottom has it.) It is a grace which requires the nicest
management; and cannot be achieved but with the best cultivation of _ear_
and _voice_; in order to catch and re-echo the tones of the heart to the
ears and hearts of others.

“Expression, therefore, is a refinement on Intonation: they go hand in
hand: we cannot think of the one without the other. Intonation gives the
voice volume and power; expression uses and adopts it to the feeling of
the moment.


ENERGY.

“Energy is intimately allied to the two preceding graces of Elocution; to
which it adds force, intensity, and earnestness. As Expression is variety
of Intonation, Energy may be called the _Emphasis of Expression_.

“It is the life, the soul, the animating spirit. Without it, the speaker
may be correct, and even agreeable, by a due observance of rule; but if
he lack _energy_, he will be listened to without interest; his voice will
fall powerless on the ear, and neither “awake the senses,” nor “stir the
blood.”

“Energy, it is true, depends somewhat on individual temperament and
constitution. But even where natural or physical energy is deficient,
an _energetic manner_ may be acquired by practice and exercise under
judicious direction; just as the muscular powers may be improved, and
bodily vigor increased, even in a feeble frame, under a course of
training and well-regulated exercise.

“Even in narration, what force, what reality can be given to a
description by a speaker who, as it were, throws himself into the
scene, and by the vivacity and energy of his delivery brings the action
graphically before your eyes, hurries you into the heat of it, and makes
you feel as if personally engaged in what is so stirringly related to you
as in that beautiful description, in Shakspeare’s _Henry IV._, of the
gallant Prince Henry and his comrades armed for battle:

              “All furnish’d, all in arms,
  Glitt’ring in golden coats like images;
  As full of spirit as the month of May,
  And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;
  Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.
  I saw young Harry,—with his beaver on,
  His cuises on his thighs, gallantly arm’d,—
  Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury,
  And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
  As if an angel dropp’d down from the clouds,
  To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus,
  And witch the world with noble horsemanship!

“Unless this description, full of poetic imagination and coloring as it
is, be delivered with warmth, _energy_, and a tone of enthusiasm, it
will fall very short of its due impression; and thus the poet will be
deprived, by the speaker’s coldness, of the full appreciation, by the
hearer, of the exquisite beauty of the picture.

“But the force of his elocution must be greatly increased, and the
expression must be changed, become impassioned, and raised almost to
_fierceness_, to produce the full effect of _Hotspur’s_ heroic and
inspiring answer: which breaths the highest enthusiasm of confident and
daring valor, undaunted resolution, and impatient thirst of glory.

“It must therefore be marked with all the _energy_ that the reader can
command.

HOTSPUR’S EAGERNESS FOR BATTLE.

                    Let them come!
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war,
  All hot, and bleeding, will we offer them!
  The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
  Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire,
  To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh,
  And yet not ours! Come, let me take my horse,
  Which is to bear me like a thunderbolt
  Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
  Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
  Meet, and ne’er part till one drop down a corse!

“Thus we see that Intonation, Energy, and Expression are kindred graces:
united and embodied in full force and with just discrimination, they
reach the climax of the power of Elocution, the acmé of its art—PASSION.

“In conclusion, I take leave to add, that I shall indeed feel proud if
this feeble attempt of mine may have the effect of awaking the reader’s
interest, exciting, and in some degree aiding him in the cultivation of
an art, on which the Orator’s success so much depends.”


ON READING OF VERSE.

The following remarks on reading verse are by the same writer:

“In the reading of verse, we must observe

1. Time and rhythm.

2. Melody and cadence.

“1. By _time_, I mean the regulation of the pulsation and movement of
sound by the voice, to the regulated metrical accentuation (or rhythm),
and construction of the verse.

“Time and rhythm are therefore inseparable and mutually dependent: one
belongs to the Poet, the other to the Elocutionist.

“English verse consists of the arrangement at regular intervals of
accented and _un_accented—or, heavy and light—syllables. This regular
arrangement makes the _rhythm_ of the verse: the number of syllables
employed in a line makes the _metre_ of the verse.

“Now if, in reading verse, we do not _regularly_ mark the pulsation of
the accented syllables,—according to their arrangement in the rhythm—at
due intervals of sound, we shall break the rhythm by reading _out of
time_.

“For example, in the Ode of Dryden, on Cecilia’s Day, occurs this
couplet; which I now mark according to the _regular_ rhythmical division
and accentuation.

  On theˊ | bare earthˊ | exposedˊ | he liesˊ |
  With notˊ | a friendˊ | to closeˊ | his eyesˊ.

“But to read the first line of the couplet thus, (accenting _the_ and not
accenting _bare_) would be to sacrifice all the force of the line, in
order to produce an unmeaning _sing-song_ by equipulsation of sound.

“We must, therefore, by art, reconcile the strength of the line with the
music of the verse; and thus divide and accent it in delivery.

  On the bareˊ | earthˊ | exposedˊ | he liesˊ.

“Sometimes the poet himself will, purposely, break the regularity of
his rhythm for expression and effect; the Elocutionist, in such cases,
must aid that effect by marking and _timing_ the pulsation of sound
accordingly. As in the following lines from Pope:

  1. _Smooth_ˊ flow the waves, the zephyrs gently play.

  2. _Wide_ˊ and more wide the floating rings advance,
    _Fill_ˊ all the wat’ry plain, _and to the mar_gin dance.

  3. Amphion there the loud creating lyre
    _Strikes_ˊ, and behold a sudden Thebes aspire!

  4. _Fame_ˊ sits aloft, and points them out their course.

  5. _Bright_ˊ as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike.

  6. _All_ˊ are but parts of one stupendous whole,
    Whose body Nature is, and God the soul;
    That chang’d through all, and yet is all the same,
    _Great_ˊ in the earth, as in the ethereal frame,
    _Warms_ˊ in the sun, _refreshes_ in the breeze,
    _Glows_ˊ in the stars, and _blossoms_ in the trees,
    _Lives_ˊ thro’ all life, _extends_ through all extent,
    _Spreads_ˊ undivided, _operates_ unspent,
    _Breathes_ˊ in our soul, _informs_ our mortal part, &c.

“The _Italicised_ words indicate the departure from the _regular_ rhythm
in these lines; most of which commence with a heavy syllable, for
force and effect. This the reader must mark by pulsation of voice,—a
prolongation of sound, or a rest, on the commencing heavy syllable, with
a lighter enunciation of the succeeding unaccented syllables.

“The occurrence of several successive unaccented syllables, lessening
the due number of accents in any line, must be balanced by a short rest
to supply the place of the deficient accent (_as in the_ 5_th and_ 6_th
lines of the_ 6_th example._) By these means the due time of the verse
will be preserved, and its movement will _echo_, (as it were,) or, at all
events, aid and strengthen the sense.

“The above verses will accordingly be read with the division and
accentuation following:

  1. Smoothˊ | flow the wavesˊ, | the zephˊyrs gent | ly playˊ.

  2. Wideˊ | and more wideˊ | the floatˊ | ing ringsˊ | advanceˊ,
    Fillˊ all | the watˊ | ’ry plainˊ, | and to the marˊ | gin danceˊ.

  3. Amphi on thereˊ | the loudˊ | creaˊ | ting lyreˊ |
    Strikesˊ, | and beholdˊ | a sudˊ | den Thebesˊ | aspireˊ!

  4. Fameˊ | sits aloftˊ, | and pointsˊ | them outˊ | their course.

  5. Brightˊ | as the sunˊ, | her eyesˊ | the gaˊ | zers strikeˊ.

  6. Allˊ | are but partsˊ | of oneˊ | stupenˊ | dous wholeˊ, |
    Whose bod | y Naˊ | ture isˊ, | and Godˊ | the soulˊ;
    That chang’dˊ | thro’ allˊ, | and yetˊ | in allˊ | the sameˊ, |
    Greatˊ | in the earthˊ, | as in | the etheˊ | real frameˊ, |
    Warmsˊ | in the sunˊ, | refreshˊ | es in the breezeˊ, |
    Glowsˊ | in the starsˊ, | and blosˊ | soms in the treesˊ, &c.


RESTS IN VERSE.

“There is another point, which properly comes under the head of _time_,
in rhythmical reading, and the due observance of which is essential to
the melody of verse: that is the rests or pauses peculiar to verse, viz.:

THE CÆSURAL REST, to divide the line; and THE REST AT THE CLOSE of each
line.

“The duration of each of these pauses or rests is equal to that of the
_short rhetorical pause_; subject, of course, to be increased by the
pause of sense.

“‘The cæsural pause may fall,’ says Blair, ‘in heroic verse, after the
fourth, the fifth, the sixth, or the seventh syllable.’

“The placing it is the poet’s business: it is the Elocutionist’s to mark
it in delivery. But if its introduction would be absolutely repugnant
to sense and just elocution, the poet must bear the fault, and his line
lose some portion of its melody by the omission; for sense cannot be
sacrificed to sound.

“The rest at the end of the line suggests itself, and must not be
omitted: the sense will most frequently enforce it; when it does not, a
rest must nevertheless be made by a suspension of voice at the end of
each line, equal to the short pause in Elocution.

EXAMPLE.

  Achilles’ wrath, | to Greece the direful spring |
  Of woes unnumbered, | heav’nly goddess sing!


EXERCISES.

“The following verses in heroic measure—that is, consisting of ten
syllables to each line, the syllables being (with occasional variations,
which are allowed) alternately light and heavy—I have marked with the
cæsural pause and rest at the end of the line. Let the student read them
_aloud_, marking these pauses, and duly observing _time_, _rhythm_, and
_poetical intonation_.

THE TEMPLE OF FAME.—_Pope._

  Four faces had the dome, | and every face |
  Of various structure | but of equal grace!
  Four brazen gates | on columns lifted high, |
  Salute the different quarters | of the sky.
  Here fabled chiefs, | in darker ages born, |
  Or worthies old, | whom arms or arts adorn, |
  Who cities rais’d, | or tam’d a monstrous race, |
  The walls, | in venerable order, | grace:
  Heroes | in animated marble | frown, |
  And legislators seem | to speak in stone.
    Westward | a sumptuous frontispiece | appear’d |
  On Doric pillars | of white marble rear’d, |
  Crown’d with an architrave | of antique mould, |
  And sculpture rising | on the roughen’d gold.
  In shaggy spoils | here Theseus was beheld, |
  And Perseus, dreadful | with Minerva’s shield:
  There great Alcides, | stooping with his toil, |
  Rests on his club, | and holds th’ Hesperian spoil:
  Here Orpheus sings; | trees wooing to the sound, |
  Start from their roots, | and form a shade around:
  Amphion there | the loud creating lyre |
  Strikes, and behold | a sudden Thebes aspire!
  Cythæron’s echoes | answer to his call, |
  And half the mountain | rolls into a wall:
  There might ye see | the lengthening spires ascend, |
  The dome swell up, | the widening arches bend, |
  The growing towers | like exultations rise, |
  And the huge columns | heave into the skies.

MELODY and CADENCE require that in reading poetry the inflections be more
smooth, or less angular, than in prose. To make the inflections as sharp
as they often are in ordinary composition, would interfere with that easy
and graceful flow which is the chief charm of poetical composition. But
while cadence adds much to the beauty of poetical expression, it must
not be carried so far as to supersede the just inflection and emphasis
which the sense demands. To do so, would be to give to the reading a
_sing-song_ tone and sameness, both unmeaning and disagreeable. Melody
may be said to relate to the whole verse in poetry; cadence applies only
to the closing line or phrase.

[3] Pronouns used as _antecedents_, and also _relatives_, when _their
antecedents are not expressed_, should obviously be pronounced with a
certain degree of emphatic force; as, “_He_ that runs may read.” “_Who_
seeks for glory often finds a grave.” “_What_ man has done, man can do.”

[4] The following is Mr. J. Sheridan Knowles’s account of
emphasis:—“EMPHASIS is of two kinds, absolute and relative. Relative
emphasis has always an antithesis expressed or implied: absolute emphasis
takes place when the peculiar eminence of the thought is solely, singly
considered.

  ’Twas base and poor, unworthy of a _peasant_,
  To forge a scroll so villainous and loose,
  And mark it with a noble lady’s name.

Here we have an example of relative emphasis; for, if the thought
were expressed at full, it would stand thus:—Unworthy not only of a
_gentleman_, but of a _peasant_.

  ’Twas base and poor, unworthy of a _man_,
  To forge a scroll so villainous and loose,
  And mark it with a noble lady’s name.

Here we have an example of absolute emphasis; for, if the thought were
expressed at full, it would stand thus:—Unworthy a being composed of
such perfections as constitute a man.” Mr. Knowles adds: “I apprehend
that, notwithstanding all that has been written on the subject, the true
definition of emphasis remains still to be discovered.”

[5] _Single_ emphasis, is when there is _one_ pair of words opposed to
each other in a sentence; _Double_ emphasis, when there are _two_ pairs;
and _Treble_, when there are _three_.




PART SECOND.

I.—TEACHING AND CHARACTER OF JESUS CHRIST.

CHATEAUBRIAND.

  Among the French writers of the nineteenth century, Chateaubriand
  has been one of the most distinguished. His “Genius of
  Christianity” is a remarkably brilliant and eloquent work.


1. JESUS CHRIST appears among men full of grace and truth; the authority
and the mildness of His precepts[6] are irresistible. He comes to heal
the most unhappy of mortals, and all His wonders are for the wretched.
In order to inculcate[7] His doctrine, He chooses the apologue,[8] or
parable, which is easily impressed[9] on the minds of the people. While
walking in the fields, He gives His divine lessons.

2. When surveying the flowers that adorn the mead, He exhorts His
disciples to put their trust in Providence, who supports the feeble
plants, and feeds the birds of the air; when He beholds the fruits of
the earth, He teaches them to judge of men by their works; an infant is
brought to Him, and He recommends innocence; being among shepherds, He
gives Himself the appellation of the _Good Shepherd_, and represents
Himself as bringing back the lost sheep to the fold.

3. In Spring He takes His seat upon the mountain, and draws from the
surrounding objects instruction for the multitude sitting at His
feet. From the very sight of this multitude, composed of the poor and
the unfortunate, He deduces His beatitudes. _Blessed are those that
weep—blessed are they that hunger and thirst._ Such as observe His
precepts, and those that slight them, are compared to two men who build
houses, the one upon a rock, and the other upon the sand. When He asks
the woman of Samaria for drink, He expounds unto her His heavenly
doctrine, under the beautiful image of a well of living water.

4. His character was amiable, open, and tender, and His charity
unbounded. The evangelist gives us a complete and admirable idea of it
in these few words: _He went about doing good._ His resignation to the
will of God is conspicuous[10] in every moment of His life; He loved and
felt the sentiment of friendship: the man whom He raised from the tomb,
Lazarus, was His friend; it was for the sake of the noblest sentiment of
life that He performed the greatest of His miracles.

5. In Him the love of country may find a model. “O, Jerusalem,
Jerusalem,” He exclaimed, at the idea of the judgments which threatened
that guilty city, “how often would I have gathered thy children together,
even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!”
Casting His sorrowful eyes from the top of a hill over this city, doomed
for her crimes to a signal destruction, He was unable to restrain His
tears: “_He beheld the city_,” says the evangelist, “_and wept over it_.”
His tolerance[11] was not less remarkable: when His disciples begged him
to command fire to come down from heaven on a village of Samaria, which
had denied Him hospitality, He replied with indignation, “_Ye know not
what manner of spirit ye are of_.”

II.—LITTLE AT FIRST, BUT GREAT AT LAST


  1. A traveler through a dusty road,
      Strewed[12] acorns on the lea,[13]
    And one took root, and sprouted up,
      And grew into a tree.
    Love sought its shade at evening time,
      To breathe its early vows,
    And Age was pleased, in heat of noon,
      To bask[14] beneath its boughs.
    The dormouse loved its dangling twigs;
      The birds sweet music bore;
    It stood a glory in its place—
      A blessing evermore.

  2. A little spring had lost its way
      Amid the grass and fern:
    A passing stranger scooped a well,
      Where weary men might turn;
    He walled it in, and hung with care
      A ladle at the brink;
    He thought not of the deed he did,
      But judged that Toil might drink.
    He passed again—and lo! the well,
      By summers never dried,
    Had cooled ten thousand parching tongues,
      And saved a life beside.

  3. A dreamer dropped a random[15] thought;
      ’Twas old, and yet ’twas new—
    A simple fancy of the brain,
      But strong in being true:
    It shone upon a genial[16] mind,
      And lo! its light became
    A lamp of life, a beacon[17] ray,
      A monitory[18] flame.
    The thought was small—its issue[19] great;
      A watch-fire on the hill,
    It sheds its radiance[20] far adown,
      And cheers the valley still!

  4. A nameless man, amid a crowd
      That thronged the daily mart,[21]
    Let fall a word of hope and love,
      Unstudied, from the heart;
    A whisper on the tumult thrown—
      A transitory[22] breath—
    It raised a brother from the dust;
      It saved a soul from death.
    Oh germ! oh fount! oh word of love!
      Oh thought at random cast!
    Ye were but little at the first,
      But _mighty at the last_!

III.—THE DEVOTED SON AND THE GENEROUS STRANGER.

BROTHER PHILIPPE.

  Brother Philippe is the present (1871) Superior General of the
  Brothers of the Christian Schools. He is the author of several
  very meritorious works. He resides in France, where during the
  late war he was remarkable, though a very old man, for his
  energy, courage and holy zeal in providing for the wants of the
  wounded and dying upon the battle fields.


1. A young man, named Robert, was waiting on the coast at Marseilles for
some one to hire his boat. A stranger entered, and was on the point of
stepping out again, notwithstanding the presence of Robert, whom he did
not suppose to be the owner. “As the boat-man is not coming,” said he, “I
shall pass into another boat.” “Sir,” said Robert, “this is my own boat,
do you wish to get out of port?” “No; I merely thought of enjoying a row
on the river before night closed in, but you don’t look like a sailor.”
“True, Sir, I am not a sailor; but the want of money forces me to seek
employment during my leisure hours.”

2. “What! avaricious[23] at your age? This is a shame which mars your
youth, and lessens the interest inspired by your pleasing appearance.”
“Ah! Sir, if you knew why I wish to make money, you would not, indeed,
add to my sorrow by believing me guilty of such a low vice.” “I may have
wronged you; but you have not explained yourself. Let us have a row;
meantime you can tell me all your troubles, for your looks have disposed
me in your favor.”

3. “I have but one trouble,” said the young man; “it is that of having
a dear father bound in chains; and this may last I know not how long!
My father was a broker in this city, and had obtained, by means of his
own and my mother’s earnings, an interest in a merchant vessel bound to
Smyrna. He took charge of the buying and the selling of the stock. The
vessel was seized by a pirate ship, and taken to Tetuan, where my father
remains prisoner, with the greater part of the ship’s crew. They demand
ten thousand francs for his ransom;[24] but, as he had made large outlays
so as to increase the business, we are far from possessing that sum.
However, my mother and my sisters work day and night, and I contrive to
do my part as a clerk in a jeweler’s shop, and I seek besides, as you
perceive, to fill up my leisure hours. We have retrenched our mode of
living in every possible way, and one room forms our lodging. At first
I thought of going to take my father’s place, and thus release him from
his cruel chains. I was about putting this idea into execution, when
my mother assured me that such an undertaking was as rash as it was
impracticable;[25] and she forbade all the captains of the Levant to take
me on board.”

4. “Do you ever hear from your father? Do you know the name of his
master in Tetuan, and in what manner is he treated?” “His master is the
intendant of the king’s gardens; they treat him with humanity, and the
labor to which he is subjected is not above his strength. But he is
our father; he is so good, and we are not there to comfort him; he is
far from us, from his dear wife and his three children, whom he loves
tenderly.”

5. “What name does he bear in Tetuan?” “It is not changed; they call him
Robert.” “Robert? in Tetuan? with the intendant[26] of the gardens?”
“Yes, Sir.”

6. “I am touched at your sorrow, my good friend; and, in consequence of
your noble sentiments, I predict[27] for you the accomplishment of your
wishes, which, indeed, you richly merit. Meanwhile, let me now enjoy a
few moments’ solitude in this spot.”

7. When it was night, Robert had orders to put him ashore. Then the
stranger, slipping a purse into the young man’s hands, disappeared
without allowing him time to express his thanks. The purse contained four
hundred francs, mostly in gold coins. Such generosity gave Robert the
highest opinion of the stranger, who had listened with so much interest
to his sad tale. In vain did Robert seek him, to assure him of his
lasting gratitude.

8. Six weeks elapsed since this extraordinary occurrence, and those good
people worked on indefatigably,[28] to complete the sum mentioned. One
day they were partaking of a frugal meal of bread and dried almonds, in
the narrow room which was their home, when a man entered, and surprised
them in the midst of their trouble and their misery. He was cleanly
clad. Heavens! ... it is Robert, their father. What astonishment! What
exclamations of joy! What tears were shed, in their happiness. Robert
embraced his wife and his children, and told them how thankful he felt
for the twelve thousand francs which he received at the moment he
embarked on the vessel, where his passage had been already paid; clothes
also were furnished him, and he knew not, he said, how to acknowledge so
much solicitude[29] and attention.

9. The surprise of the mother and the children increased at every word
spoken; they could not comprehend this mysterious language, and they
looked at each other in their bewilderment. At length, the mother broke
silence: she supposed that her son had done all this without consulting
her; she told her husband how zealously he had labored since the
beginning of his captivity; how he had endeavored to go and replace him,
and how she had prevented him from so doing. “Ten thousand francs,” added
she, “were necessary for the ransom; we had but a little more than the
half, most part of which was acquired[30] by his attention to business;
for the rest, friends must have aided him.”

11. All at once the disheartened father grew thoughtful and gloomy, and
thus addressed his son: “Unhappy boy, can I owe you my liberty without
regret? How could it have remained a secret to your mother, and not be
bought at the price of virtue? At your age, unhappy son of a slave, one
cannot easily obtain so much money. I shudder to think that filial piety
may have made you culpable.[31] Confide in me, be sincere, do not conceal
the truth; have you been guilty of dishonesty?”

12. “Banish your fears, dear father,” cried the virtuous son, as he
embraced him tenderly; “your child is not unworthy of this title, nor
lucky enough to have effected your freedom, which, in truth, you do not
owe to me; I know your benefactor—oh, yes, I know him. Do you remember,
dear mother, the stranger who gave me his purse—how he questioned me
thus: ‘Where is your father? What is his name? Who is his master?’ Were I
to spend my whole life, I shall find him again, and he shall admire the
fruits of his generosity.”

Then his dutiful son related the incident which had taken place,
restoring, meanwhile, the peace and the happiness which had, for a
moment, given place to fear.

13. Restored to his family, the honest Robert found friends and means.
Success surpassed his hopes. After ten years, he had acquired a little
fortune; and his children, who were all settled in life, shared the
happiness of their father and mother.

IV.—THE CHRISTIAN MOTHER.

MARY I. HOFFMAN.

  Miss Hoffman is an American authoress of very marked ability. Her
  “Agnes Hilton,” “Alice Murray,” and “Felix Kent” are works of
  fiction of great and deserved popularity.


1. It was a poor, dilapidated[32] house in a narrow lane; no curtains
shaded the small windows through which the glaring sun came mockingly in.
A table stood in the middle of the room, with—we cannot say the remains
of the last meal, for the meal had been too scant to have any remains—but
with the soiled cups and plates still unremoved; the cold stove looked
as if it had never known what it was to have a good fire blazing and
burning within it; back by the wall was an old scuttle, in which were a
few coals, evidently placed there away from the stove, lest too close
proximity[33] might tempt to using them before the time to heat the
teakettle for the next meal came round.

2. On a little bench sat a pale, thin-faced child of seven or eight
years. An old, threadbare coat, very much too large, was wrapped around
him, completely covering, or rather burying him in its ample folds. After
one or two ineffectual attempts he succeeded in disengaging[34] his
little hands, and then smoothed back the golden locks from his broad,
handsome brow.

3. On the floor were two little girls, one five, the other three. They
were playing with bits of cloth and shreds of ribbons, ever and anon
pausing to look up in the face of a middle-aged woman sitting by the
window, sewing on a jacket as fast as her hand could fly. She had on a
faded dress of mourning, and her countenance looked sorrow-stricken and
worn.

4. On a bed in one corner was lying a boy of fifteen or sixteen years. He
was very pale, and with the sunken eyes closed, the chin slightly fallen,
the ashen lips parted, displaying the large even teeth, a looker-on might
have congratulated himself that the vital[35] spark had fled—that the
spirit had found a happier home. But his languid eyes opened, and a groan
escaped his lips.

5. His mother started and exclaimed:

“Oh, Alfred, that pain has again awakened you!”

“No, mother, no, I was not asleep,” he sorrowfully replied.

“Not asleep, Alfred! I thought you were, you lay so quiet.”

“I know it, but I only had my eyes closed, thinking of the time we lived
in Stanton, and it all came back so plain, that I thought this poor, cold
room was only a dream, but I opened my eyes, and oh, mother, it wasn’t,
it wasn’t!” Clasping his hands, he cried: “What a change since father
died, what a change!” and sobs choked the further utterance of the poor,
sick boy.

6. “Oh, Alfred, dear Alfred,” said his mother, while unbidden tears came
into her eyes; “your father was too good to be left here to suffer. He
was called home to heaven—to heaven,” she slowly repeated, dropping
her needle and pressing her hand upon her heart to keep down its
tumultuous[36] throbbings. Then, after a moment’s pause, she added:

“But, Alfred, be patient; God will not forget us.”

“Forget us!” he exclaimed, starting up and looking wildly around, “why,
mother, it seems we are already forgotten.”

“No, Alfred, don’t say that; God is so good and merciful, He sends us
these trials to disengage our minds from the world, and prepare us for
heaven; His beautiful heaven, child. You remember when, in Stanton, we
used to read of it, and think we could even suffer martyrdom to show our
love and gratitude to our dear Lord, who came on earth and died that we
might enjoy it. And now, when pain and suffering come upon us, shall we
murmur and repine?”

7. “Oh, mother, I don’t want to murmur,[37] but—oh, it is so much easier
to talk of pain than it is to suffer it.”

“But, Alfred, dear, any pain or trial sent by God, if we only bear it
with patience and resignation, will be showing the same love as if we
died for Him.”

“Why, mother!” he exclaimed, forgetting, in his surprise, the great
weakness that a moment before had gathered around his heart; “your words
seem so strange, I will not say irreverent—but, mother, to compare our
trials to martyrdom seems—seems so presumptuous.”[38]

8. Pausing an instant in her sewing, she fixed a steadfast gaze upon him;
perceiving the conversation was not wearying him, she said:

“Alfred, I have often wished in this sickness to tell you my thoughts
on this subject, for it seems they were suggested by my good angel,
to strengthen and comfort me. You have been so weak, that I have not
dared to dwell on any subject, or use more words than were absolutely
necessary. But now I see you are able to hear me, and I will speak.”

9. “Yes, do, mother, do tell me something that will comfort me too; for,
oh, how sad, how stricken I feel!” His large eyes looked haggard and
wild. The little boy on the bench moved nearer, and, bending over with
his elbows on his knees and his chin resting on his tiny palms, fixed his
blue eyes wonderingly upon her, listening intently to what she was about
to say. Newly threading her needle, she commenced;

“Alfred, a martyr suffers death through love of God, and rather than
consent to an act displeasing to Him; in other words, rather than do any
thing that would offend Him.”

“Yes, mother, but—”

“Wait, my child, wait. If now, through the same love of God, and through
fear of offending Him, we suffer our trials and afflictions with patience
and resignation, is it not the same spirit which leads one to martyrdom?
is it not, my child, the same?”

10. He paused a moment before replying, and then slowly said: “In the
way in which you present it to my view, it really does seem so, mother;
but—” placing his hand upon his heart, “I wish I could make it seem so
here.” He raised himself on his elbow and gazed round the desolate room;
a wintry smile lit up his wan countenance.

“Oh, mother,” he bitterly exclaimed, “to talk of glorious martyrdom and
joyous heaven in this wretched, wretched home of poverty!”

11. “Why not, my child?” she asked, in her kindest and most soothing
tones. “Is it not the very place to talk of them? Has Alfred forgotten
the cold little stable of Bethlehem, and the poor, comfortless home of
Egypt? No, no, Alfred, poverty itself can never exclude[39] us from
heaven. One single sin may forever close its gates, but, let us be ever
so poor and wretched, we still have just as great a claim to heaven as
the richest; perhaps even greater; remember Lazarus.”

11. Clasping her thin hands, while a smile played over her worn features,
she continued:

“It may come upon us—poverty may—with such crushing force that we will
have to lie down and die; but then it will be _our_ path to heaven,
_our_ road home. Home! Oh, Alfred, what comfort in that word! There
we will meet father, mother, sisters, brothers, and all will be joy
and happiness. Every tear will be wiped away, and all the sorrow and
wretchedness of the way-side forgotten. Yes, Alfred, from this very room,
so poor and cold, we may go to a home all beautiful and bright.” With a
hurried hand she resumed her sewing. Alfred was silent, but the cloud had
passed from his brow.

V.—WOODMAN, SPARE THAT TREE.

MORRIS.

  George P. Morris, an American writer, was born October 10, 1802,
  and died July 6, 1864. He was the author of many popular songs.


  1. Woodman, spare that tree;
      Touch not a single bough;
    In youth it sheltered me,
      And I’ll protect it now.
    ’Twas my forefather’s[40] hand
      That placed it near his cot;
    Then, woodman, let it stand;
      Thy axe shall harm it not.

  2. That old, familiar[41] tree,
      Whose glory and renown[42]
    Are spread o’er land and sea,
      And wouldst thou hew it down?
    Woodman, forbear thy stroke:
      Cut not its earth-bound ties;
    O, spare that aged oak,
      Now towering[43] to the skies.

  3. When but an idle boy,
      I sought its grateful shade;
    In all their gushing[44] joy.
      Here, too, my sisters played.
    My mother kissed me here;
      My father pressed my hand:
    Forgive this foolish tear,
      But let that old oak stand.

  4. My heartstrings round thee cling,
      Close as thy bark, old friend!
    Here shall the wild bird sing,
      And still thy branches bend.
    Old tree, the storm still brave!
      And, woodman, leave the spot;
    While I’ve a hand to save,
      Thy axe shall harm it not.

VI.—THE TWO ROADS.


1. It was New Year’s night. An aged man was standing at a window. He
raised his mournful eyes towards the deep blue sky, where the stars were
floating, like white lilies, on the surface of a clear, calm lake. Then
he cast them on the earth, where few more hopeless beings than himself
now moved towards their certain goal[45]—the tomb.

2. Already he had passed sixty of the stages[46] which lead to it, and he
had brought from his journey nothing but errors and remorse. His health
was destroyed, his mind vacant, his heart sorrowful, and his old age
devoid of comfort.

3. The days of his youth rose up in a vision[47] before him, and he
recalled the solemn moment when his father had placed him at the
entrance of two roads—_one_ leading into a peaceful, sunny land, covered
with a fertile harvest, and resounding with soft, sweet songs; the
_other_ leading the wanderer into a deep, dark cave, whence there was
no issue[48], where poison flowed instead of water, and where serpents
hissed and crawled.

4. He looked towards the sky, and cried out in his agony, “O youth,
return! O my father, place me once more at the entrance to life, that I
may choose the better way!” But his father and the days of his youth had
both passed away.

5. He saw wondering lights floating away over dark marshes, and then
disappear. _These_ were the days of his wasted life. He saw a star fall
from heaven, and vanish in darkness. This was an emblem[49] of himself,
and the sharp arrows of unavailing remorse[50] struck home to his heart.
Then he remembered his early companions, who entered on life with him,
but who, having trod the paths of virtue and of labor, were now honored
and happy on this New Year’s night.

6. The clock, in the high church tower, struck, and the sound, falling
on his ear, recalled his parents’ early love for him, their erring son;
the lessons they had taught him; the prayers they had offered up in his
behalf. Overwhelmed with shame and grief, he dared no longer look towards
that heaven where his father dwelt; his darkened eyes dropped tears, and
with one despairing effort, he cried aloud, “Come back, my early days!
come back!”

7. And his youth _did_ return; for all this was but a dream which visited
his slumbers on New Year’s night. He was still young; his faults alone
were real. He thanked God fervently that time was still his own; that he
had not yet entered the deep, dark cavern, but that he was free to tread
the road leading to the peaceful land where sunny harvests wave.

8. Ye who still linger on the threshold[51] of life, doubting which path
to choose, remember that, when years are passed, and your feet stumble on
the dark mountain, you will cry bitterly[52], but cry in vain, “O youth,
return! O, give me back my early days!”

[51] THRESHˊOLD, a door-sill; beginning; entrance.

[52] BITˊTER-LY, sorrowfully.




VII.—THE LABORERS.


  1. You can not pay with money
      The million sons of toil—
    The sailor on the ocean,
      The peasant on the soil,
    The laborer in the quarry,
      The hewer of the coal;
    Your money pays the _hand_,
      But it can not pay the _soul_.

  2. You gaze on the cathedral[53]
      Whose turrets[54] meet the sky:
    Remember the foundations
      That in earth and darkness lie:
    For, were not those foundations
      So darkly resting there,
    Yon towers up could never soar
      So proudly in the air.

  3. The workshop must be crowded,
      That the palace may be bright;
    If the plowman did not plow,
      Then the poet could not write.
    Then let every toil be hallowed[55]
      That man performs for man,
    And have its share of honor
      As part of one great plan.

  4. See, light darts down from heaven,
      And enters where it may;
    The eyes of all earth’s people
      Are cheered with one bright day.
    And let the _mind’s_ true sunshine
      Be spread o’er earth _as_ free,
    And fill the souls of men,
      As the waters fill the sea.

  5. The man who turns the soil
      Need not have an earthly mind;
    The digger ’mid the coal
      Need not be in spirit blind:
    The mind can shed a light
      On each worthy labor done,
    As lowliest things are bright
      In the radiance[56] of the sun.

  6. What cheers the musing[57] student?
      The poet, the divine?
    The thought that, for his followers,
      A brighter day will shine.
    Let every human laborer
      Enjoy the vision bright—
    Let the thought that comes from heaven.
      Be spread like heaven’s own light!

  7. Ye men who hold the pen,
      Rise like a band inspired;[58]
    And, poets, let your lyrics[59]
      With hope for man be fired;[60]
    Till the earth becomes a temple,
      And every human heart
    Shall join in one great service,
      Each happy in his part.

VIII.—THE BOY.

WILLIS.


  1. There’s something in a noble boy,
      A brave, free-hearted, careless one,
    With his unchecked, unbidden joy,
      His dread of books and love of fun,
    And in his clear and ready smile,
    Unshaded by a thought of guile,
      And unrepressed[61] by sadness,—
    Which brings me to my childhood back,
    As if I trod its very track,
      And felt its very gladness.

  2. And yet, it is not in his play,
      When every trace of thought is lost,
    And not when you would call him gay,
      That his bright presence thrills me most:
    His shout may ring upon the hill,
      His voice be echoed in the hall,
    His merry laugh like music trill,
      And I in sadness hear it all,—
    For, like the wrinkles on my brow,
    I scarcely notice such things now,—

  3. But when, amid the earnest game,
      He stops, as if he music heard,
    And, heedless of his shouted name
      As of the carol[62] of a bird,
    Stands gazing on the empty air,
    As if some dream were passing there;—
      ’Tis then that on his face I look—
    His beautiful but thoughtful face—
      And like a long-forgotten book,
    Its sweet familiar meanings trace,—

  4. Remembering a thousand things
    Which passed me on those golden wings,
      Which time has fettered now;
    Things that came o’er me with a thrill,
    And left me silent, sad, and still,
      And threw upon my brow
    A holier and a gentler cast,
    That was too innocent to last.

  5. ’Tis strange how thoughts upon a child
      Will, like a presence, sometimes press,
    And when his pulse is beating wild,
      And life itself is in excess[63]—
    When foot and hand, and ear and eye,
    Are all with ardor[64] straining high—
      How in his heart will spring
    A feeling whose mysterious[65] thrall[66]
    Is stronger, sweeter far than all!
      And on its silent wing,
    How, with the clouds, he’ll float away,
    As wandering and as lost as they!

[61] UN-RE-PRESSED, not subdued or mastered.

[62] CARˊ-OL, a song of great joy.

[63] EX-CESSˊ, that which exceeds or surpasses what is usual or necessary.

[64] ARˊ-DOR, warmth or heat of passion or affection; eagerness.

[65] MYS-TEˊ-RI-OUS, secret; not easily understood.

[66] THRALL, bondage; slavery.




IX.—THE YOUNG SHEPHERD.

FENELON.

  The illustrious Fenelon, archbishop of Cambray, in France, was
  born in 1651 and died, at Cambray, in 1715. He was as remarkable
  for sanctity as for genius. His purity, meekness and amiability,
  won the hearts of all—even of his enemies, if it can be said that
  he had any.


1. Sha-Abbas, king of Persia, being on his travels, withdrew from his
retinue,[67] in order to visit the country, and there, without being
known, to behold mankind in all their native freedom. He took with him
only one of his officers, as an attendant.

2. “I am weary,” said he, “of living among sycophants,[68] who take all
occasions to over-reach, while they flatter me. I am determined to visit
husbandmen and shepherds, who know nothing of me.”

3. He traveled, with his confidant, through several villages where the
peasants were dancing, and was overjoyed to see that his subjects,
though at such a distance from court, had their diversions, and those so
innocent and unexpensive.

4. After refreshing himself in a cottage, he crossed a meadow,
enameled[69] with flowers, which decked the borders of a limpid[70]
stream. Here he spied a young shepherd, playing on his pipe beneath a
shady elm, while his flocks were grazing around him.

5. The king accosts him, surveys him closely, finds his aspect agreeable,
and his air, though easy and natural, yet graceful and majestic. The
simple habit[71] in which the shepherd was clad, did not in the least
diminish the agreeableness of his person. The king supposed him at first
to be a youth of illustrious birth, who had disguised himself; but he
learned from the shepherd that his parents dwelt in an adjacent[72]
village, and that his name was Alibeg.

6. The more questions the king put to him, the more he admired the
strength and solidity of his genius. His eyes were lively, and
beaming[73] with intelligence; his voice was sweet and melodious; his
features were not rude, neither were they soft and effeminate.[74] The
shepherd, though sixteen years of age, did not seem conscious of those
perfections which were conspicuous to others. He imagined that his
thoughts, his conversation, and his person, were not unlike those of his
neighbors.

7. The king frequently smiled at the innocent freedom of the youth, who
gave him much information about the state of the people. He gave the
officer who accompanied him a private signal not to discover that he was
the king, for fear that Alibeg, if he once knew with whom he conversed,
would lose in an instant, his wonted[75] freedom, and all his native
graces.

8. “I am now convinced,” said the prince to his attendant, “that nature
is as beautiful in the lowest state as in the highest. No monarch’s son
was ever born with nobler faculties than this young shepherd. I should
think myself infinitely happy, had I a son equally handsome, intelligent,
and ingenuous.[76] I will have him educated at my own court.”

9. The king accordingly took Alibeg away with him; and the youthful
shepherd was much surprised to find that a prince should be so pleased
with his conversation. Taken to court, he was instructed by proper tutors
in all the graces which add to manly beauty, and in all the arts and
sciences which adorn the mind.

10. The grandeur of the court, and a sudden change of fortune, in some
measure influenced the temper of Alibeg. His crook, his pipe, and
shepherd’s dress, were now forsaken; and, instead of them, he appeared in
a purple robe embroidered with gold, and a turban enriched with jewels.
Alibeg was handsomer than any other man at court. He was qualified to
transact the most important affairs, and his master, placing the utmost
confidence in his integrity,[77] soon conferred on him the post of
jewel-keeper and treasurer of his household.

11. During the whole reign of the great Sha-Abbas, Alibeg’s reputation
daily increased. But, as he advanced in years, he frequently recalled to
mind his former state of life, and always with regret. “Oh, happy days!”
would he whisper to himself; “oh, innocent days! days, wherein I tasted
true joys without danger; days, since which I never saw one so pleasant,
shall I not see you any more? He who has deprived me of you, by making me
thus great, has utterly undone me.”

X. THE YOUNG SHEPHERD—CONTINUED.


1. Alibeg, after a long absence, revisited his native village. Here he
gazed with fondness on those places where he had formerly danced, sung,
and tuned his pipe with his fellow-swains.[78] He made presents to
all his friends and relations; but advised them, as they valued their
peace of mind, never to resign their rural pleasures, never to expose
themselves to the anxieties and misfortunes of a court. Alibeg felt the
weight of those misfortunes, soon after the death of his good master
Sha-Abbas.

2. Sha-Sephi succeeded his father. Some envious, artful courtiers[79]
found means to prejudice the young prince against him. “He has,” said
they, “betrayed the trust reposed in him by the late king. He has hoarded
up immense treasures, and embezzled[80] valuable effects.”

3. Sha-Sephi was young, and a monarch; which was more than sufficient to
make him credulous[81] and inconsiderate. He had, besides, the vanity
to think himself qualified to reform his fathers acts, and to judge of
things better than the latter had done. To have some plea for removing
Alibeg from his post, he commanded him to produce the cimeter,[82] set
with diamonds of an immense value, which his royal grandsire used to wear
in battle. Sha-Abbas had formerly ordered these to be taken off; and
Alibeg brought witnesses to prove that they were so removed long before
his promotion.

4. When Alibeg’s enemies found this scheme too weak to effect his ruin,
they prevailed on Sha-Sephi to give him strict orders to produce an exact
inventory[83] of all the rich furniture intrusted to his care. Alibeg
opened the doors, and showed every thing committed to his charge. No one
article was missing: each was in its proper place, and preserved with
great care.

5. The king, surprised to see such order every where observed, began
to entertain a favorable opinion of Alibeg, till he espied, at the
end of a long gallery, an iron door, with three strong locks. “There
it is,” whispered the envious courtiers in his ear, “that Alibeg has
concealed all the valuable effects which he has purloined.”[84] The
king now angrily exclaimed, “I will see what is in that room. What have
you concealed there? Show it me.” Alibeg fell prostrate at his feet,
beseeching him not to take from him all that he now held valuable upon
earth.

6. Sha-Sephi now took it for granted that Alibeg’s ill-gotten treasure
lay concealed within. He commanded the door to be opened. Alibeg, who had
the keys in his pocket, unlocked the door. Nothing, however, was found
there, but his crook, his pipe, and the shepherd’s dress which he wore in
his youth.

7. “Behold great sir,” said he, “the remains of my former felicity,[85]
which neither fortune nor your majesty have taken from me. Behold my
treasure, which I reserve to make me rich, when you shall think proper
to make me poor. Take back every thing besides; but leave me these dear
pledges of my rural[86] station. These are my substantial riches which
will never fail me.

8. “These, O king! are the precious, yet innocent possessions of those
who can live contented with the necessaries of life, without tormenting
themselves about superfluous[87] enjoyments. These are riches which
are possessed with liberty and safety; riches which never give me one
moment’s disquiet. Oh, ye dear implements of a plain, but happy life!
I value none but you; with you I will live, and with you die. I here
resign, great sir, the many favors which your royal bounty[88] has
bestowed upon me.”

9. The king, convinced of Alibeg’s innocence, instantly banished his
accusers from court. Alibeg became his prime minister, and was intrusted
with the most important secrets. He visited, however, every day, his
crook, his pipe, and rural habit, that he might remember them, should
fickle fortune deprive him of a monarchˊs favor. He died in a good old
age, without wishing to have his enemies punished, or to increase his
possessions; and left his relations no more than what would maintain them
in the station of shepherds, which he always thought the safest and most
happy.

XI.—OLD TIMES.

GERALD GRIFFIN.

  Gerald Griffin was born in Ireland in 1803. He was a
  distinguished novelist and dramatist. He has also written some
  short poems remarkable for their tenderness of feeling and beauty
  of expression.

  While still a young man he withdrew from the pursuits of
  literature and joined the Brothers of the Christian Schools. He
  died in 1840 at the early age of thirty-seven.


  1. Old times! old times! the gay old times!
      When I was young and free,
    And heard the merry Easter chimes,
      Under the sally tree;
    My Sunday palm beside me placed,
      My cross upon my hand,
    A heart at rest within my breast,
      And sunshine on the land!
              Old times! old times!

  2. It is not that my fortunes flee,
      Nor that my cheek is pale,
    I mourn whene’er I think of thee,
      My darling native vale!
    A wiser head I have, I know,
      Than when I loitered there;
    But in my wisdom there is woe,
      And in my knowledge care,
              Old times! old times!

  3. I’ve lived to know my share of joy,
      To feel my share of pain,
    To learn that friendship’s self can cloy,
      To love and love in vain—
    To feel a pang and wear a smile,
      To tire of other climes,
    To like my own unhappy isle,
      And sing the gay old times!
              Old times! old times!

  4. And sure the land is nothing changed,
      The birds are singing still;
    The flowers are springing where we ranged,
      There’s sunshine on the hill;
    The sally waving o’er my head,
      Still sweetly shades my frame,
    But ah, those happy days are fled,
      And I am not the same!
              Old times! old times!

  5. Oh, come again, ye merry times!
      Sweet, sunny, fresh, and calm;
    And let me hear those Easter chimes,
      And wear my Sunday palm.
    If I could cry away mine eyes,
      My tears would flow in vain;
    If I could waste my heart in sighs,
      They’ll never come again!
              Old times! old times!




XII.—THE BROKEN HEART.

IRVING.

  Washington Irving was born in the City of New York, in 1783 and
  died in 1859. His writings are deservedly popular. His “Sketch
  Book,” “Life of Goldsmith,” “Life of Columbus,” “Conquest of
  Granada,” and other works, have made him as well known to
  European as to American readers.


1. Every one must recollect the tragical[89] story of young Emmet, the
Irish patriot; it was too touching to be soon forgotten. His fate made
a deep impression on public sympathy. During the troubles in Ireland he
was tried, condemned, and executed[90] on a charge of treason. He was so
young, so intelligent, so generous, so brave, so everything that we are
apt to like in a young man. His conduct under trial, too, was so lofty
and intrepid. The noble indignation with which he repelled[91] the charge
of treason against his country, the eloquent vindication of his name, and
his pathetic appeal to posterity, in the hopeless hour of condemnation,
all these entered deeply into every generous bosom, and even his enemies
lamented the stern policy that dictated his execution.

2. But there was _one_ heart whose anguish it would be impossible to
describe. In happier days and fairer fortunes, he had won the affections
of a beautiful and interesting girl, the daughter of a late celebrated
Irish barrister. She loved him with the disinterested fervor[92] of a
woman’s first and early love. When every worldly maxim arrayed itself
against him; when blasted in fortune, and disgrace and danger darkened
around his name, she loved him the more ardently for his sufferings. If,
then, his fate could awaken the sympathy even of his foes, what must have
been the agony of her whose whole soul was occupied by his image! Let
_those_ tell who have had the portals[93] of the tomb suddenly closed
between them and the being they most loved on earth, who have sat at its
threshold, as one shut out in a cold and lonely world, whence all that
was most lovely and loving had departed.

3. But then the horrors of such a grave! so frightful, so dishonored!
there was nothing for memory to dwell on, that could soothe the pangs
of separation, none of those tender, though melancholy circumstances,
which endear the parting scene, nothing to melt sorrow into those blessed
tears, sent like the dews of heaven to revive the heart in the parting
hour of anguish.

4. To render her widowed situation more desolate, she had incurred her
fathers displeasure by her unfortunate attachment, and was an exile from
the paternal roof. But could the sympathy and kind offices of friends
have reached a spirit so shocked and driven in by horror, she would
have experienced no want of consolation, for the Irish are a people of
quick and generous sensibilities.[94] The most delicate and cherishing
attentions were paid her by families of wealth and distinction. She was
led into society, and they tried by all kinds of occupation and amusement
to dissipate[95] her grief, and wean her from the tragical story of her
love.

5. But it was all in vain. There are some strokes of calamity which
scathe and scorch the soul, which penetrate to the vital seat of
happiness, and blast it, never again to put forth bud or blossom. She
never objected to frequent the haunts of pleasure, but was as much alone
there as in the depths of solitude[96] walking about in a sad reverie,
apparently unconscious of the world around her. She carried with her an
inward woe, that mocked at all the blandishments[97] of friendship, and
“heeded not the song of the charmer, charm he never so wisely”.

6. The person who told me her story had seen her at a masquerade[98].
There can be no exhibition of far-gone wretchedness more striking and
painful than to meet it in such a scene; to find it wandering like a
specter, lone and joyless, where all around is gay, to see it dressed
out in the trappings of mirth, and looking so wan and woe-begone,
as if it had tried in vain to cheat the poor heart into a momentary
forgetfulness of sorrow.

7. After strolling through the splendid rooms and giddy crowd with an
air of utter abstraction,[99] she sat herself down on the steps of an
orchestra,[100] and, looking about for some time with a vacant air, that
showed her insensibility to the garish[101] scene, she began with the
capriciousness[102] of a sickly heart, to warble a little plaintive air.
She had an exquisite voice; but on this occasion it was so simple, so
touching, it breathed forth such a soul of wretchedness, that she drew a
crowd mute and silent around her, and melted every one into tears.

8. The story of one so true and tender, could not but excite great
interest in a country remarkable for enthusiasm. It completely won the
heart of a brave officer, who paid his address to her, and thought that
one so true to the dead could not but prove affectionate to the living.
She declined his attentions, for her thoughts were irrevocably engrossed
by the memory of her former lover. He, however, persisted in his suit.
He solicited not her tenderness, but her esteem. He was assisted by her
conviction of his worth, and her sense of her own destitute and dependent
situation, for she was existing on the kindness of friends. In a word, he
at length succeeded in gaining her hand, though with the solemn assurance
that her heart was unalterably another’s.

9. He took her with him to Sicily, hoping that a change of scene might
wear out the remembrance of her early woes. She was an amiable and
exemplary wife, and made an effort to be a happy one; but nothing could
cure the silent and devouring melancholy that had entered into her very
soul. She wasted away in a slow but hopeless decline, and, at length,
sank into the grave, the victim of a broken heart.

  10. She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps,
        And lovers are around her, sighing;
      But coldly she turns from their gaze, and weeps,
        For her heart in his grave is lying!

  11. She sings the wild song of her dear native plains,
        Every note which he loved awaking;
      Ah! little they think who delight in her strains,
        How the heart of the Minstrel is breaking!

  12. He had lived for his love, for his country he died,
        They were all that to life had entwined him;
      Nor soon shall the tears of his country be dried,
        Nor long will his love stay behind him.

  13. O! make her a grave where the sunbeams rest,
        When they promise a glorious morrow;
      They’ll shine o’er her sleep, like a smile from the West,
        From her own loved island of sorrow!

XIII.—LITTLE VICTORIES.

  REMARK.—In conversational pieces like the following, the manner
  of each speaker should be imitated, as in a dialogue.


1. “Oh, mother, now that I have lost my limb, I can never be a soldier
or a sailor; I can never go round the world!” And Hugh burst into tears,
now more really afflicted than he had ever been yet. His mother sat on
the bed beside him, and wiped away his tears as they flowed, while he
told her, as well as his sobs would let him, how long and how much he had
reckoned on going round the world, and how little he cared for anything
else in future; and now this was the very thing he should never be able
to do!

2. He had practiced climbing ever since he could remember, and now this
was of no use; he had practiced marching, and now he should never march
again. When he had finished his complaint, there was a pause, and his
mother said, “Hugh, you have heard of Huber.”

“The man who found out so much about bees?” said Hugh.

“Bees and ants. When Huber had discovered[103] more than had ever been
known about these, and when he was sure that he could learn still more,
and was more and more anxious to peep into their tiny[104] homes, and
curious ways, he became blind.”

3. Hugh sighed, and his mother went on.

“Did you ever hear of Beethoven? He was one of the greatest musical
composers[105] that ever lived. His great, his sole delight, was in
music. It was the passion of his life. When all his time and all his mind
were given to music, he suddenly became deaf, perfectly deaf; so that
he never more heard _one single note_ from the loudest orchestra[106].
While crowds were moved and delighted with his compositions[107] it was
all silence to him.” Hugh said nothing.

4. “Now do you think,” asked his mother—and Hugh saw that a mild and
gentle smile beamed from her countenance—“do you think that these people
were without a heavenly Parent?”

“Oh no! but were they patient?” asked Hugh.

“Yes, in their different ways and degrees. Would you suppose that they
were hardly treated? Or would you not rather suppose, that their Father
gave them something better to do, than they had planned for themselves?”

5. “He must know best, of course; but it does seem very hard, that _that
very thing_ should happen to them. Huber would not have so much minded
being deaf, perhaps; or that musical man being blind.”

“No doubt their hearts often swelled within them, at their
disappointments; but I fully believe that they very soon found God’s
will to be wiser than their wishes. They found, if they bore their trial
well, that there was work for their hearts to do, far nobler than any the
head could do through the eye, or the ear. And they soon felt a new and
delicious pleasure, which none but the bitterly disappointed can feel.”

“What is that?”

6. “The pleasure of rousing the soul to bear pain, and of agreeing
with God silently, when nobody knows what is in the breast. There is
no pleasure like that of exercising one’s soul in bearing pain, and of
finding one’s heart glow with the hope that one is pleasing God.”

“Shall I feel that pleasure?”

“Often and often, I have no doubt; every time you can willingly give
up your wish to be a soldier, or a sailor, or any thing else you have
set your mind upon, you will feel that pleasure. But I do not expect it
of you yet. I dare say, it was long a bitter thing to Beethoven to see
hundreds of people in raptures[108] with his music when he could not hear
a note of it.”

7. “But did he ever smile again?” asked Hugh.

“If he did, he was happier than all the fine music in the world could
have made him,” replied his mother.

“I wonder, oh, I wonder if I shall ever feel so!”

“We will pray to God that you may. Shall we ask him now?”

Hugh clasped his hand. His mother kneeled beside the bed, and, in a very
few words, prayed that Hugh might be able to bear his misfortune[109]
well, and that his friends might give him such help and comfort as God
should approve.

XIV.—LITTLE VICTORIES.—CONTINUED.


8. Hugh found himself subject to very painful feelings sometimes, such as
no one quite understood, and such as he feared no one was able to pity
as they deserved. On one occasion, when he had been quite merry for a
while, and his mother and sister Agnes were chatting[110] they thought
they heard a sob from the sofa. They spoke to Hugh, and found that he was
indeed crying bitterly.

“What is it, my dear,” said his mother. “Agnes, have we said anything
that could hurt his feelings?”

“No, no,” sobbed Hugh. “I will tell you presently.”

9. And presently he told them, that he was so busy listening to what
they said, that he forgot every thing else, when he felt as if something
got between two of his toes; unconsciously he put down his hand, as if
his foot was there! Nothing could be plainer than the feeling in his
toes; and, then, when he put out his hand, and found nothing, it was so
terrible! it startled him so! It was a comfort to find that his mother
knew about this. She came, and kneeled by his sofa, and told him that
many persons who had lost a limb, considered this the most painful thing
they had to bear, for some time; but that, though the feeling would
return occasionally through life, it would cease to be painful.

10. Hugh was very much dejected[111], and when he thought of the months
and years, to the end of his life, and that he should never run and play,
and never be like other people, he almost wished that he was dead.

Agnes thought that he must be miserable indeed, if he could venture to
say this to his mother. She glanced at her mother’s face, but there was
no displeasure there. On the contrary, she said this feeling was very
natural. She had felt it herself, under smaller misfortunes than Hugh’s;
but she had found, though the prospect appears all strewn[112] with
troubles, that they come singly, and are not so hard to bear, after all.

11. She told Hugh, that when she was a little girl, she was very lazy,
fond of her bed, and not at all fond of dressing or washing.

“Why, mother! you?” exclaimed Hugh.

“Yes; that was the sort of little girl I was. Well, I was in despair, one
day, at the thought that I should have to wash and clean my teeth, and
brush my hair, and put on every article of dress, every morning as long
as I lived.”

“Did you tell any body?” asked Hugh.

12. “No; I was ashamed to do that; but I remember I cried. You see how it
turns out. When we have become accustomed to any thing, we do it without
ever thinking of the trouble, and, as the old fable tells us, the clock,
that has to tick so many millions of times, has exactly the same number
of seconds to do it in. So will you find, that you can move about on each
separate occasion, as you wish, and practise will enable you to do it
without any trouble or thought.”

“But this is not all, nor half what I mean,” said Hugh.

13. “No, my dear, nor half what you will have to bear. You resolved to
bear it all patiently, I remember. But what is it you dread the most?”

“Oh! all manner of things. I can never do like other people.”

“Some things,” replied his mother. “You can never play cricket, as every
Crofton boy would like to do. You can never dance at your sister’s
Christmas parties.”

14. “Oh! mamma!” cried Agnes, with tears in her eyes, and with the
thought in her mind, that it was cruel to talk so.

“Go on! go on!” cried Hugh, brightening. “You know what I feel, mother;
and you don’t keep telling me, as others do, and even sister Agnes,
sometimes, that it will not signify much, and that I shall not care, and
all that; making out that it is no misfortune, hardly, when I know what
it is, and they don’t. Now then, go on, mother! What else?”

15. “There will be little checks and mortifications continually, when you
see little boys leaping over this, and climbing that, and playing at the
other, while you must stand out, and can only look on. And some people
will pity you, in a way you will not like; and some may even laugh at
you.”

“Oh mamma!” exclaimed Agnes.

“Well, and what else?” said Hugh.

16. “Sooner or later, you will have to follow some way of life determined
by this accident, instead of one that you would have liked better.”

“Well, what else?”

“I must ask you, now. I can think of nothing more; and I hope there is
not much else; for, indeed, I think here is quite enough for a boy, or
any one else, to bear.”

“I will bear it, though; you will see.”

17. “You will find great helps. These misfortunes, of themselves
strengthen one’s mind. They have some advantages, too. You will be a
better scholar for your lameness, I have no doubt. You will read more
books, and have a mind richer in thoughts. You will be more beloved by us
all, and you yourself will love God more for having given you something
to bear for His sake. God Himself will help you to bear your trials.
You will conquer your trials one by one, and by a succession of LITTLE
VICTORIES, will, at last, completely triumph over all.”

XV.—OUR TITLES.


  1. Are we not Nobles? we who trace
      Our Pedigree[113] so high,
    That God for us and for our race
      Created Earth and Sky,
    And Light, and Air, and Time, and Space,
      To serve us, and then die.

  2. Are we not Princes? we who stand
      As heirs beside the Throne;
    We who can call the promised land
      Our Heritage,[114] our own;
    And answer to no less command
      Than God’s, and His alone.

  3. Are we not Kings? both night and day,
      From early until late,
    About our bed, about our way,
      A guard of Angels wait;
    And so we watch, and work, and pray
      In more than royal state.

  4. Are we not holy? do not start;
      It is God’s sacred will
    To call us Temples set apart
      His Holy Ghost may fill;
    Our very food.... Oh hush, my heart,
      Adore _It_ and be still!

  5. Are we not more? Our life shall be
      Immortal[115] and divine;
    The nature Mary gave to Thee,
      Dear Jesus, still is Thine;
    Adoring in Thy Heart I see
      Such blood as beats in mine.

  6. O God! that we can dare to fail,
      And dare to say we must!
    O God, that we can ever trail
      Such banners in the dust,
    Can let such starry honors pale,
      And such a Blazon[116] rust!

  7. Shall we upon such Titles bring
      The taint of sin and shame?
    Shall we, the children of the King
      Who hold so grand a claim,
    Tarnish, by any meaner thing,
      The glory of our name?

XVI.—THE WIDOW OF THE PINE COTTAGE.


1. It was Saturday night, and the widow of the Pine Cottage sat by
her blazing fagots,[117] with her five tattered children at her side,
endeavoring, by listening to the artlessness, of their prattle,[118] to
dissipate[119] the heavy gloom that pressed upon her mind. For a year,
her own feeble hand had provided for her helpless family, for she had no
supporter: she thought of no friend in all the wide, unfriendly world
around.

2. But that mysterious Providence, the wisdom of whose ways is above
human comprehension, had visited her with wasting sickness, and her
little means had become exhausted. It was now, too, mid-winter, and the
snow lay heavy and deep through all the surrounding forests, while storms
still seemed gathering in the heavens, and the driving wind roared among
the neighboring pines, and rocked her puny[120] mansion.

3. The last herring smoked upon the coals before her; it was the only
article of food she possessed, and no wonder her forlorn, desolate state
brought up in her lone bosom all the anxieties of a mother, when she
looked upon her children; and no wonder, forlorn as she was, if she
suffered the heart-swellings of despair to rise, even though she knew
that He, whose promise is to the widow and to the orphan, can not forget
his word.

4. Providence had, many years before, taken from her her eldest son,
who went from his forest home to try his fortune on the high seas,
since which she had heard no tidings of him; and, later still, the
hand of death deprived her of the companion and staff of her earthly
pilgrimage,[121] in the person of her husband. Yet to this hour she had
upborne; she had not only been able to provide for her little flock,
but had never lost an opportunity of ministering to the wants of the
miserable and destitute.

5. The indolent may well bear with poverty, while the ability to gain
sustenance remains. The individual who has but his own wants to supply,
may suffer with fortitude the winter of want; his affections are not
wounded, his heart not wrung. The most desolate in populous cities may
hope, for charity has not quite closed her hand and heart, and shut her
eyes on misery.

6. But the industrious mother of helpless and depending children, far
from the reach of human charity, has none of these to console her. And
such a one was the widow of the Pine Cottage; but as she bent over the
fire, and took up the last scanty remnant of food, to spread before
her children, her spirits seemed to brighten up, as by some sudden and
mysterious impulse, and Cowper’s beautiful lines came uncalled across her
mind:

  Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
    But trust Him for His grace;
  Behind a frowning Providence
    He hides a smiling face.

7. The smoked herring was scarcely laid upon the table, when a gentle
rap at the door, and loud barking of a dog, attracted the attention
of the family. The children flew to open it, and a weary traveler, in
tattered garments, and apparently indifferent health, entered and begged
a lodging, and a mouthful of food. Said he, “It is now twenty-four hours
since I tasted bread.” The widow’s heart bled anew as under a fresh
complication[122] of distresses; for her sympathies[123] lingered not
around her fireside. She hesitated not even now; rest and a share of all
she had she proffered to the stranger. “We shall not be forsaken,” said
she, “or suffer deeper for an act of charity.”

8. The traveler drew near the board, but when he saw the scanty fare, he
raised his eyes toward heaven with astonishment: “And is this _all_ your
store?” said he, “and a share of this do you offer to one you know not?
then never saw I _charity_ before! but, madam,” said he, continuing, “do
you not wrong your _children_ by giving a part of your last mouthful to a
stranger?”

9. “Ah,” said the poor widow, and the tear-drops gushed[124] into her
eyes as she said it, “I have a _boy_, a darling _son_, somewhere on the
face of the wide world, unless heaven has taken him away, and I only act
toward you, as I would that others should act toward him. God, who sent
manna[125] from heaven, can provide for us as He did for Israel; and how
should I this night offend Him, if my son should be a wanderer, destitute
as you, and He should have provided for him a home, even poor as this,
were I to turn you unrelieved away.”

10. The widow ended, and the stranger, springing from his seat, clasped
her in his arms: “God, indeed, has provided your son a home, and has
given him wealth to reward the goodness of his benefactress: my mother!
oh, my mother!” It was her long-lost son, returned to her bosom from the
Indies. He had chosen that disguise that he might the more completely
surprise his family; and never was surprise more perfect, or followed by
a sweeter cup of joy.

11. That humble residence in the forest was exchanged for one
comfortable, and indeed beautiful, in the valley; and the widow lived
long with her dutiful son, in the enjoyment of worldly plenty, and in
the delightful employments of virtue; and, at this day, the passer-by is
pointed to the willow that spreads its branches above her grave.

XVII.—A PSALM OF LIFE.

LONGFELLOW.

  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was born at Portland, Maine, in 1807.
  He is one of the most popular of living poets.


  1. Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
      Life is but an empty dream!
    For the soul is dead that slumbers,
      And things are not what they seem.

  2. Life is _real_! Life is _earnest_!
      And the grave is _not_ its goal;
    Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
      Was not spoken of the _soul_.

  3. Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
      Is our destined[126] end or way,
    But to act, that each to-morrow
      Find us farther than to-day.

  4. Art is long, and time is fleeting;
      And our hearts, though stout and brave,
    Still, like muffled[127] drums, are beating
      Funeral marches to the grave.

  5. In the world’s broad field of battle,
      In the bivouac[128] of life,
    Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
      Be a hero in the strife!

  6. Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant,
      Let the dead past bury its dead!
    Act—act in the living Present!
      Heart within, and God o’erhead.

  7. Lives of great men all remind us,
      We can make our lives sublime;[129]
    And, departing, leave behind us
      Foot-prints[130] on the sands of time;—

  8. Foot-prints, that, perhaps, another,
      Sailing over life’s solemn[131] main,[132]
    A forlorn[133] and shipwrecked brother,
      Seeing, shall take heart again.

  9. Let us, then, be up and doing,
      With a heart for any fate;
    Still achieving,[134] still pursuing,[135]
      Learn to labor, and to wait.

    Though Fame may wreathe[137] her laurels[138] fair,
      Around your youthful brow,—
    If you would rise from earthly things,
      And win a deathless name,
    Let all your ways be just and right—
      _Let virtue be your aim_.[139]

  2. Though cherished[140] friends may traitors[141] prove.
      Their kindness all depart,
    And leave a mournful spell around
      Thy sad and bleeding heart;
    Though you may oft be scorned[142] by men,
      Or those who bear the name,
    Let all your ways be just and right—
      _Let virtue be your aim_.

  3. Oh! ye who dwell in stately[143] halls,
      Where wealth and fame[144] are known,
    Remember you may yet be poor,
      Neglected and alone!
    But, oh! remember this broad truth,
      Ere others’ faults you scan,[145]
    Your wealth may make a thousand fools—
      BUT VIRTUE MAKES THE MAN.

XIX. -THE BOBOLINK.

W. IRVING.


1. The happiest bird of our spring, and one that rivals[146] the
European lark, in my estimation,[147] is the Bobolink. He arrives at
that choice portion of the year, which, in this latitude, answers to the
description[148] of the month of May, so often given by the poets. With
us, it begins about the middle of May, and lasts until nearly the middle
of June.

2. Earlier than this, winter is apt to return on its traces, and to
blight[149] the opening beauties of the year; and later than this,
begin the parching, and panting, and dissolving[150] heats of summer.
But, in this genial[151] interval,[152] Nature is in all her freshness
and fragrance; “the rain is over and gone, the flowers appear on the
earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the
turtle[153] is heard in our land.”

3. The trees are now in their fullest foliage[154] and the brightest
verdure; the woods are gay with the clustered[155] flowers of the laurel;
the air is perfumed by the sweet-brier and the wild rose; the meadows are
enameled[156] with clover-blossoms; while the young apple, the peach, and
the plum, begin to swell, and the cherry to glow among the green leaves.

4. This is the chosen season of revelry[157] of the Bobolink. He
comes amidst the pomp and fragrance of the season; his life seems all
sensibility[158] and enjoyment, all song and sunshine. He is to be found
in the soft bosoms of the freshet and sweetest meadows; and is most in
song when the clover is in blossom.

5. He perches[159] on the topmost twig of a tree, or on some flaunting
weed, and, as he rises and sinks with the breeze, pours forth a
succession[160] of rich, tinkling notes, crowding one upon another,
like the outpouring melody of the sky-lark, and possessing the same
rapturous[161] character.

6. Sometimes he pitches from the summit of a tree, begins his song as
soon as he gets upon the wing, and flutters tremulously[162] down to
the earth, as if overcome with ecstasy[163] at his own music. Sometimes
he is in pursuit of his paramour;[164] always in full song, as if he
would win her by his melody; and always with the same appearance of
intoxication[165] and delight.

7. Of all the birds of our groves and meadows, the Bobolink was the
envy of my boyhood. He crossed my path in the sweetest weather, and the
sweetest season of the year, when all Nature called to the fields, and
the rural[166] feeling throbbed in every bosom; but, when I, luckless
urchin, was doomed to be mewed[167] up, during the livelong day, in a
school-room, it seemed as if the little varlet[168] mocked at me, as he
flew by in full song, and sought to taunt me with his happier lot. O,
how I envied him! No lessons, no tasks, no schools; nothing but holiday,
frolic, green fields, and fine weather.

XX.—THE BOBOLINK.—CONTINUED.


1. Farther observation and experience have given me a different idea of
this little feathered voluptuary,[169] which I will venture to impart,
for the benefit of my school-boy readers, who may regard him with the
same unqualified envy and admiration which I once indulged.

2. I have shown him only as I saw him at first, in what I may call the
poetical part of his career, when he, in a manner, devoted himself to
elegant pursuits and enjoyments, and was a bird of music, and song, and
taste, and sensibility, and refinement. While this lasted, he was sacred
from injury; the very school-boy would not fling a stone at him, and the
merest rustic[170] would pause to listen to his strain.

3. But mark the difference. As the year advances, as the clover-blossoms
disappear, and the spring fades into summer, his notes cease to
vibrate[171] on the ear. He gradually gives up his elegant tastes and
habits, doffs his poetical and professional suit of black, assumes a
russet,[172] or rather a dusky garb, and enters into the gross enjoyments
of common, vulgar birds.

4. He becomes a _bon vivant_, a mere gormand;[173] thinking of nothing
but good cheer, and gormandizing on the seeds of the long grasses, on
which he lately swung and chanted so musically. He begins to think there
is nothing like “the joys of the table,” if I may be allowed to apply
that convivial[174] phrase to his indulgences. He now grows discontented
with plain, every-day fare, and sets out on a gastronomical[175] tour, in
search of foreign luxuries.[176]

5. He is to be found in myriads[177] among the reeds of the Delaware,
banquetting[178] on their seeds; grows corpulent[179] with good feeding,
and soon acquires the unlucky renown of the Ortolan.[180] Wherever he
goes, _pop! pop! pop!_ the rusty firelocks of the country are cracking
on every side; he sees his companions falling by thousands around him;
he is the _reed-bird_, the much-sought for tit-bit of the Pennsylvanian
epicure.[181]

6. Does he take warning and reform? Not he! He wings his flight still
farther south in search of other luxuries. We hear of him gorging[182]
himself in the rice swamps; filling himself with rice almost to bursting;
he can hardly fly for corpulency. Last stage of his career, we hear of
him spitted by dozens, and served up on the table of the gormand, the
most vaunted[183] of southern dainties, the _rice-bird_ of the Carolinas.

7. Such is the story of the once musical and admired, but finally
sensual[184] and persecuted[185] Bobolink. It contains a _moral_, worthy
the attention of all little birds and little boys, warning them to keep
to those refined and intellectual[186] pursuits, which raised him to
such a pitch of popularity, during the early part of his career; but to
eschew[187] all tendency to that gross and dissipated[188] indulgence,
which brought this mistaken little bird to an untimely end.

XXI.—WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR?


  1. Thy neighbor? It is he whom thou
      Hast power to aid[189] and bless,
    Whose aching heart, or burning brow
      Thy soothing[190] hand may press.

  2. Thy neighbor? ’Tis the fainting poor,
      Whose eye with want is dim,
    Whom hunger sends from door to door—
      Go thou, and succor[191] him.

  3. Thy neighbor? ’Tis that weary[192] man,
      Whose years are at their brim,
    Bent low with sickness, cares and pain—
      Go thou, and comfort him.

  4. Thy neighbor? ’Tis the heart bereft[193]
      Of every earthly gem:
    Widow[194] and orphan helpless left—
      Go thou, and shelter them.

  5. Whene’er thou meet’st a human form
      Less favored[195] than thine own,
    Remember ’tis thy neighbor worm,

XXII.—PORTRAIT OF A VIRTUOUS AND ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN.

FENELON.


1. Antiope is mild, simple, and wise; her hands despise not labor; she
foresees things at a distance; she provides against contingencies[196]
she knows when it is proper to be silent; she acts regularly and without
hurry; she is continually employed, but never embarrassed,[197] because
she does every thing in its proper season.

2. The good order of her father’s house is her glory, it adds greater
luster[198] to her than beauty. Though the care of all lies upon
her, and she is charged with the burden of reproving,[199] refusing,
retrenching[200] (things which make almost all women hated), yet she has
acquired the love of all the household; and this, because they do not
find in her either passion, or conceitedness,[201] or levity, or humors
as in other women. By a single glance of her eye, they know her meaning,
and are afraid to displease her.

3. The orders she gives are precise; she commands nothing but what can be
performed; she reproves with kindness, and in reproving encourages. Her
father’s heart reposes upon her as a traveler, fainting beneath the sun’s
sultry rays, reposes himself upon the tender grass under a shady tree.

4. Antiope is a treasure worth seeking in the most remote corners of the
earth. Neither her person nor her mind is set off with vain ornaments;
and her imagination, though lively, is restrained by her discretion. She
never speaks but through necessity; and when she opens her mouth, soft
persuasion and simple graces flow from her lips. When she speaks, every
one is silent; and she is heard with such attention, that she blushes,
and is almost inclined to suppress[202] what she intended to say; so that
she is rarely ever heard to speak at any length.

XXIII.—THE WORK OF TO-DAY.

CHARLES MACKAY.


  1. If Fortune with a smiling face,
      Strew roses on our way,
    When shall we stoop to pick them up?
      _To-day_, my friend, _to-day_.
    But should she frown with face of care.
      And talk of coming sorrow,
    When shall we grieve if grieve[203] we must?
      _To-morrow_, friend, _to-morrow_.

  2. If those who’ve wronged us, own their fault,
      And kindly pity pray,
    When shall we listen, and forgive?
      _To-day_, my friend, _to-day_.
    But, if stern[204] Justice urge[205] rebuke,[206]
      And warmth from Memory borrow,
    When shall we chide,[207] if chide we dare?
      _To-morrow_, friend, _to-morrow_.

  3. If those to whom we owe a debt,
      Are harmed unless we pay,
    When shall we struggle to be just?
      _To-day_, my friend, _to-day_.
    But, if our debtor[208] fail our hope,
      And plead his ruin thorough,[209]
    When shall we weigh his breach[210] of faith?
      _To-morrow_, friend, _to-morrow_.

  4. For virtuous[211] acts, and harmless joys,
      The minutes will not stay;
    We’ve always time to welcome them,
      _To-day_, my friend, _to-day_.
    But care, resentment,[212] angry words,
      And unavailing sorrow,
    Come far too soon, if they appear
      _To-morrow_, friend, _to-morrow_.

XXIV.—THE AVARICIOUS MILLER.

GOLDSMITH.

  Oliver Goldsmith was born in 1731, at Pallasmore, County of
  Longford, Ireland, and died in 1774. The works of Goldsmith are
  more popular to-day than those of any English author of the
  Eighteenth Century. He was equally successful as a novelist and
  a poet. His “Vicar of Wakefield”, “Traveller,” and “Deserted
  Village” are each models of excellence in their way. His essays,
  also, have rare merit.


1. Whang, the miller, was naturally avaricious;[213] nobody loved money
better than he, or more respected those that had it. When people would
talk of a rich man in company, Whang would say, “_I_ know him very
well; _he_ and _I_ have been very long acquainted; _he_ and _I_ are
intimate.”[214]

2. But, if a poor man was mentioned, he had not the least knowledge of
the man; he might be very well, for aught _he_ knew; but he was not fond
of making many acquaintances, and loved to choose his company.

3. Whang, however, with all his eagerness[215] for riches, was poor. He
had nothing but the profits of his mill to support him; but, though these
were small, they were certain: while it stood and went, he was sure of
eating; and his frugality[216] was such, that he, every day, laid some
money by; which he would, at intervals, count and contemplate with much
satisfaction.

4. Yet still his acquisitions[217] were not equal to his desires; he
only found himself above want, whereas he desired to be possessed of
affluence.[218] One day, as he was indulging these wishes, he was
informed that a neighbor of his had found a pan of money under ground,
having dreamed of it three nights in succession.[219]

5. These tidings were daggers to the heart of poor Whang. “Here am I,”
said he, “toiling and moiling[220] from morning till night for a few
paltry farthings, while neighbor Thanks only goes quietly to bed, and
dreams himself into thousands before morning. Oh, that I could dream like
him! With what pleasure would I dig round the pan! How slyly would I
carry it home! Not even my wife should see me! And then, oh the pleasure
of thrusting one’s hands into a heap of gold up to the elbows!”

6. Such reflections only served to make the miller unhappy. He
discontinued[221] his former assiduity;[222] he was quite disgusted[223]
with small gains, and his customers began to forsake him. Every day he
repeated the wish, and every night laid himself down in order to dream.
Fortune, that was for a long time unkind, at last, however, seemed to
smile upon his distress, and indulged[224] him with the wished-for vision.

7. He dreamed that under a certain part of the foundation of his mill,
there was concealed a monstrous[225] pan of gold and diamonds, buried
deep in the ground, and covered with a large flat stone. He concealed
his good luck from every person, as is usual in money-dreams, in order
to have the vision repeated the two succeeding[226] nights, by which he
should be certain of its truth. His wishes in this, also, were answered;
he still dreamed of the same pan of money, in the very same place.

8. Now, therefore, it was past a doubt; so, getting up early the third
morning, he repaired, alone, with a mattock[227] in his hand, to the
mill, and began to undermine[228] that part of the wall to which the
vision directed. The first omen[229] of success that he met with was a
broken ring; digging still deeper, he turned up a house-tile, quite new
and entire.

9. At last, after much digging, he came to a broad, flat stone; but,
then, it was so large, that it was beyond his strength to remove it.
“_There_,” cried he in raptures to himself, “_there it is!_ under this
stone, there is room for a very large pan of diamonds, indeed. I must
even go home to my wife, and tell her the whole affair, and get her to
assist me in turning it up.” Away, therefore, he goes, and acquaints his
wife with every circumstance of their good fortune.

10. Her raptures, on this occasion, may easily be imagined;[230] she
flew round his neck, and embraced him in an agony of joy. But these
transports, however, did not allay their eagerness to know the exact
sum; returning together to the place where Whang had been digging, there
they found—not, indeed, the expected treasure—but the mill, their only
support, undermined and fallen!

XXV.—THE DEATH OF THE LITTLE SCHOLAR.

DICKENS.

  Charles Dickens died in 1870. He was the most popular English
  novelist of our day.


1. Without further preface, he conducted them into his little
school-room, which was parlor and kitchen likewise, and told them they
were welcome to remain under his roof till morning. The child looked
round the room as she took her seat. The chief ornaments of the walls
were certain moral sentences, fairly copied in good round text, and
well-worked sums in simple addition and multiplication, evidently
achieved[231] by the same hand, which were plentifully pasted around the
room; for the double purpose, as it seemed, of bearing testimony to the
excellence of the school, and kindling a worthy emulation in the bosoms
of the scholars.

2. “Yes,” said the schoolmaster, observing that her attention was caught
by these specimens, “that’s beautiful writing, my dear.” “Very sir,”
replied the child, modestly; “is it yours?” “Mine!” he returned, taking
out his spectacles, and putting them on, to have a better view of the
triumphs so dear to his heart; “I couldn’t write like that nowadays. No:
they are all done by one hand; a little hand it is; not so old as yours,
but a very clever[232] one.”

3. As the schoolmaster said this, he saw that a small blot of ink had
been thrown upon one of the copies; so he took a penknife from his
pocket, and going up to the wall carefully scratched it out. When he had
finished, he walked slowly backward from the writing, admiring it as one
might contemplate[233] a beautiful picture, but with something of sadness
in his voice and manner, which quite touched the child, though she was
unacquainted with its cause.

4. “A little hand, indeed,” said the poor schoolmaster. “Far beyond all
his companions, in his learning and his sports too. How did he ever come
to be so fond of me! That I should love him is no wonder, but that he
should love me—” And there the schoolmaster stopped, and took off his
spectacles to wipe them, as though they had grown dim. “I hope there is
nothing the matter, sir,” said Nell, anxiously.

5. “Not much, my dear,” returned the schoolmaster; “I hoped to have seen
him on the green to-night. He was always foremost among them. But he’ll
be there to-morrow.” “Has he been ill?” asked the child with a child’s
quick sympathy.

6. “Not very. They said he was wandering in his head yesterday, dear
boy, and so they said the day before. But that’s a part of that kind
of disorder; it’s not a bad sign—not at all a bad sign.” The child was
silent. He walked to the door, and looked wistfully out. The shadows of
night were gathering, and all was still.

7. “If he could lean on somebody’s arm, he would come to me, I know,” he
said, returning into the room.

“He always came into the garden to say good night. But perhaps his
illness has only just taken a favorable turn, and it’s too late for him
to come out, for it’s very damp, and there’s a heavy dew. It’s much
better he shouldn’t come to-night.”

8. The next day, towards night, an old woman came tottering up the garden
as speedily as she could, and meeting the schoolmaster at the door, said
he was to go to Dame West’s directly, and had best run on before her.
He and the child were on the point of going out together for a walk, and
without relinquishing her hand, the schoolmaster hurried away, leaving
the messenger to follow as she might.

9. They stopped at a cottage door, and the schoolmaster knocked softly at
it with his hand. It was opened without loss of time. They passed into an
inner room, where his infant friend, half-dressed, lay stretched upon a
bed.

10. He was a very young boy; quite a little child. His hair still hung
in curls about his face, and his eyes were very bright; but their light
was of heaven, not earth. The schoolmaster took a seat beside him, and
stooping over the pillow, whispered his name. The boy sprang up, threw
his wasted arms around his neck, crying out that he was his dear, kind
friend.

11. “I hope I always was. I meant to be, God knows,” said the poor
schoolmaster. “Who is that?” said the boy, seeing Nell. “I am afraid to
kiss her, lest I should make her ill. Ask her to shake hands with me.”

12. The sobbing child came closer up, and took the little languid hand in
hers. Releasing his again after a time, the sick boy laid him gently down.

13. “You remember the garden, Harry,” whispered the schoolmaster, anxious
to rouse him, for a dulness seemed gathering upon the child, “and how
pleasant it used to be in the evening? You must make haste to visit it
again, for I think the very flowers have missed you, and are less gay
than they used to be. You will come soon, my dear, very soon now, won’t
you?”

14. The boy smiled faintly—so very, very faintly—and put his hand upon
his friend’s gray head. He moved his lips, too, but no voice came from
them, no, not a sound. In the silence that ensued, the hum of distant
voices, borne upon the evening air, came floating through the open window.

15. “What’s that?” said the sick child, opening his eyes. “The boys at
play upon the green.” He took a handkerchief from his pillow, and tried
to wave it above his head. But the feeble arm dropped powerless down.
“Shall I do it?” said the schoolmaster.

16. “Please wave it at the window,” was the faint reply. “Tie it to the
lattice.[234] Some of them may see it there. Perhaps they’ll think of me,
and look this way.”

17. He raised his head, and glanced from the fluttering signal to his
idle bat, that lay, with slate and book, and other boyish property, upon
a table in the room. And then he laid him down softly once more, and
asked if the little girl were there, for he could not see her.

18. She stepped forward and pressed the passive hand that lay upon the
coverlet. The two old friends and companions—for such they were, though
they were man and child—held each other in a long embrace, and then the
little scholar turned his face towards the wall, and fell asleep.

19. The poor schoolmaster sat in the same place, holding the small, cold
hand in his, and chafing it. It was but the hand of a dead child. He felt
that; and yet he chafed it still, and could not lay it down.

XXVI.—GOD, THE TRUE SOURCE OF CONSOLATION.

MOORE.

  Thomas Moore was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1779, and died
  in 1852. He was the sweetest and most brilliant lyric poet of
  his time. Many of his Irish melodies are unequaled for their
  sparkling gems of wit and fancy, and for deep and tender
  sentiment.


  1. O Thou, who dry’st the mourner’s tear,
      How dark this world would be,
    If, when deceived and wounded here,
      We could not fly to Thee!

  2. The friends, who in our sunshine live,
      When winter comes, are flown;
    And he who has but tears to give,
      Must weep those tears alone.

  3. But Thou wilt heal the broken heart
      Which like the plants that throw
    Their fragrance from the wounded part,
      Breathes sweetness out of woe.

  4. When joy no longer soothes or cheers,
      And e’en the hope that threw
    A moment’s sparkle o’er our tears,
      Is dimm’d and vanish’d too!

  5. Oh! who could bear life’s stormy doom,
      Did not Thy wing of love
    Come brightly wafting through the gloom
      Our peace-branch from above!

  6. Then, sorrow, touch’d by Thee, grows bright
      With more than rapture’s ray,
    As darkness shows us worlds of light,
      We never saw by day.




XXVII.—THE MARTYRDOM OF ST. AGNES.

DE VERE.

  Aubrey De Vere is one of the most gifted and accomplished of
  living poets.


  ANGELS.

  1. Bearing lilies in our bosom,
      Holy Agnes, we have flown
    Missioned from the Heaven of Heavens
      Unto thee, and thee alone.
    We are coming, we are flying,
    To behold thy happy dying.

  AGNES.

  2. Bearing lilies far before you,
      Whose fresh odors, backward blown,
    Light those smiles upon your faces,
      Mingling sweet breath with your own,
    Ye are coming smoothly, slowly,
    To the lowliest of the lowly.

  ANGELS.

  3. Unto us the boon was given;
      One glad message, holy maid,
    On the lips of two blest spirits,
      Like an incense-grain was laid.
    As it bears us on like lightning,
    Cloudy skies are round us brightening.

  AGNES.

  4. I am here, a mortal maiden:
      If our father aught hath said,
    Let me hear His words and do them.
      Ought I not to feel afraid,
    As ye come, your shadows flinging
    O’er a breast, to meet them springing?

  ANGELS.

  5. Agnes, there is joy in Heaven;
      Gladness, like the day, is flung
    O’er the spaces never measured,
      And from every angel’s tongue
    Swell those songs of impulse vernal,
    All whose echoes are eternal.

  6. Agnes, from the depth of Heaven
      Joy is rising, like a spring
    Borne above its grassy margin,
      Borne in many a crystal ring;
    Each o’er beds of wild flowers gliding,
    Over each low murmurs sliding.

  7. When a Christian lies expiring,
      Angel choirs, with plumes outspread,
    Bend above his death-bed, singing:
      That, when Death’s mild sleep is fled,
    There may be no harsh transition
    While he greets the Heavenly Vision.

  AGNES.

  8. Am I dreaming, blessed angels?
      Late ye floated two in one;
    Now, a thousand radiant spirits
      Round me weave a glistening zone.
    Lilies, as they wind extending,
    Roses with those lilies blending.

  9. See! th’ horizon’s ring they circle;
      Now they gird the zenith blue;
    And now, o’er every brake and billow
      Float like mist and flash like dew.
    All the earth, with life o’erflowing,
    Into heavenly shapes is growing!

  10. They are rising! they are rising!
      As they rise, the veil is riven!
    They are rising! I am rising—
      Rising with them into Heaven!—
    Rising with those shining legions
    Into life’s eternal regions!




XXVIII.—THE MONK OF ST. FRANCIS.

STERNE.


1. A poor monk, of the Order of St. Francis, came into the room to beg
something for his convent. The moment I cast my eyes upon him, I was
determined not to give him a single sous; and accordingly I put my
purse into my pocket—buttoned it up—set myself a little more upon my
center, and advanced up gravely to him: there was something, I fear,
forbidding[235] in my look: I have his figure[236] this moment before my
eyes, and think there was that in it which deserved better.

2. The monk, as I judged from the break in his tonsure, a few scattered
white hairs upon his temples being all that remained of it, might be
about seventy; but from his eyes and that sort of fire which was in them,
which seemed more tempered[237] by courtesy than years, he could be no
more than sixty—truth might lie between—he was certainly sixty-five; and
the general air of his countenance, notwithstanding something seemed
to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the
account.

3. It was one of those heads which Guido has often painted—mild, pale,
penetrating; free from all commonplace ideas of fat contented ignorance,
looking downwards upon the earth. It looked forwards; but looked as
if it looked at something beyond this world.... It would have suited
a Brahmin;[238] and had I met it upon the plains of Hindostan, I had
reverenced it.

4. The rest of his outline may be given in a few strokes: one might
put it into the hands of any one to design; for it was neither elegant
nor otherwise, but as character and expression made it so. It was a
thin, spare form, something above the common size, if it lost not the
distinction by a bend forwards in the figure—but it was the attitude[239]
of entreaty; and, as it now stands present to my imagination, it gained
more than it lost by it.

5. When he had entered the room three paces, he stood still; and,
laying his left hand upon his breast (a slender white staff with which
he journeyed being in his right), when I had got close up to him, he
introduced himself with the little story of the wants of his convent,
and the poverty of his order—and did it with so simple a grace—and such
an air of deprecation[240] was there in the whole cast of his look and
figure—I was bewitched not to have been struck with it. A better reason
was, I had predetermined not to give him a single sous.

6. “’Tis very true,” said I, replying to a cast upwards with his eyes,
with which he had concluded his address—“’tis very true—and heaven be
their resource[241] who have no other but the charity of the world; the
stock of which, I fear, is no way sufficient for the many great claims
which are hourly made upon it.”

7. As I pronounced the words “great claims,” he gave a slight glance with
his eye downwards upon the sleeve of his tunic.[242] I felt the full
force of the appeal. “I acknowledge it,” said I—“a coarse habit, and
that but once in three years, with meagre diet, are no great matters:
and the true point of pity is, as they can be earned in the world with so
little industry, that your order should wish to procure them by pressing
upon a fund which is the property of the lame, the blind, the aged, and
the infirm.

8. “The captive who lies down counting over and over again the days of
his afflictions, languishes also for his share of it; and had you been of
the order of mercy, instead of the order of St. Francis, poor as I am,”
continued I, pointing at my portmanteau,[243] “full cheerfully should it
have been opened to you for the ransom of the unfortunate.” The monk made
me a bow.

9. “But,” resumed I, “the unfortunate of our own country, surely, have
the first right; and I have left thousands in distress upon the English
shore.” The monk gave a cordial wave with his head, as much as to say, no
doubt, there is misery enough in every corner of the world, as well as
within our convent. “But we distinguish,” said I, laying my hand upon the
sleeve of his tunic, in return for his appeal—“we distinguish, my good
father, betwixt those who wish only to eat the bread of their own labor,
and those who eat the bread of other people’s, and have no other plan in
life, but to get through it in sloth and ignorance for the love of God.”

10. The poor Franciscan made no reply: a hectic of a moment passed across
his cheek, but could not tarry. Nature seemed to have done with her
resentments in him; he showed none—but, letting his staff fall within
his arm, he pressed both his hands with resignation upon his breast, and
retired.

11. My heart smote me the moment he shut the door. “Pshaw!” said I, with
an air of carelessness, three several times; but it would not do: every
ungracious syllable I had uttered, crowded back into my imagination; I
reflected I had no right over the poor Franciscan, but to deny him; and
that the punishment of that was enough to the disappointed, without the
addition of unkind language. I considered his gray hairs—his courteous
figure seemed to re-enter, and gently ask me what injury he had done me,
and why I could use him thus. I would have given twenty livres[244] for

XXIX.—MY MOTHER’S GRAVE.

DR. BROWNSON.

  Dr. Brownson is a writer of very great ability. His “Review,”
  which he conducted for several years, and for which he wrote
  nearly every article, was marked by unrivaled logical power and
  great boldness and independence. Since the discontinuance of his
  “Review,” he has published the “American Republic” a very able
  and elaborate work.


1. I lingered several weeks around the grave of my mother, and in the
neighborhood where she had lived. It was the place where I had passed my
own childhood and youth. It was the scene of those early associations
which become the dearer to us as we leave them the farther behind. I
stood where I had sported in the freedom of early childhood; but I stood
alone, for no one was there with whom I could speak of its frolics.[245]
One feels singularly desolate[246] when he sees only strange faces, and
hears only strange voices in what was the home of his early life.

2. I returned to the village where I resided when I first introduced
myself to my readers. But what was that spot to me now? Nature had done
much for it, but nature herself is very much what we make her. There must
be beauty in our souls, or we shall see no loveliness in her face; and
beauty had died out of my soul. She who might have recalled it to life
and thrown its hues over all the world was—but of that I will not speak.

3. It was now that I really needed the hope of immortality.[247] The
world was to me one vast desert, and life was without end or aim. The
hope of immortality! We want it when earth has lost its gloss of novelty;
when our hopes have been blasted, our affections withered, and the
shortness of life and the vanity of all human pursuits have come home to
us and made us exclaim,[248] “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity:” we want
then the hope of immortality to give to life an end, an aim.

4. We all of us at times feel this want. The infidel feels it in early
life. He learns all too soon, what to him is a withering fact, that man
does not complete his destiny on earth. Man never completes any thing
here. What then shall he do if there be no hereafter? With what courage
can I betake myself to my task? I may begin; but the grave lies between
me and the completion.[249] Death will come to interrupt my work, and
compel me to leave it unfinished.

5. This is more terrible to me than the thought of ceasing. I could
almost (at least I think I could) consent to be no more after I had
finished my work, achieved[250] my destiny; but to die before my work is
completed, while that destiny is but begun,—this is the death which comes
to me indeed as a “King of Terrors.”

6. The hope of another life to be the complement[251] of this, steps in
to save us from this death to give us the courage and the hope to begin.
The rough sketch shall hereafter become the finished picture: the artist
shall give it the last touch at his easel, the science we had just begun
shall be completed, and the incipient[252] destiny shall be achieved.
Fear not then to begin; thou hast eternity before thee in which to end.

[245] FROLˊ-ICS, wild pranks; scenes of mirth.

[246] DESˊ-O-LATE, lonely; comfortless.

[247] IMˊ-MOR-TAL-I-TY, endless existence hereafter.

[248] EX-CLAIMˊ, cry out.

[249] COM-PLEˊ-TION, fulfillment.

[250] A-CHIEVEDˊ, accomplished.

[251] COMˊ-PLE-MENT, that which completes.

[252] IN-CIPˊ-I-ENT, commencing; beginning.




XXX.—GOOD COUNSEL.


1. Never speak anything for a truth, which you know or believe to be
false. Lying is a great sin against God, who gave us a tongue to speak
the truth, and not falsehood. It is a great offense against humanity[253]
itself; for, where there is no regard to truth, there can be no safe
society between man and man.

2. And it is an injury to the speaker; for, beside the disgrace which
it brings upon him, it occasions so much baseness of mind, that he can
scarcely tell the truth, or avoid lying, even when he has no color of
necessity for it; and, in time, he comes to such a pass, that as other
people can not believe he speaks the truth, so he himself scarcely knows
when he tells a falsehood.

3. You must not equivocate[254] nor speak anything positively for which
you have no authority, but report, or conjecture, or opinion.

4. Let your words be few, especially, when your superiors or strangers
are present, lest you betray your own weakness, and rob yourselves of
the opportunity which you might, otherwise, have had to gain knowledge,
wisdom, and experience by hearing those whom you silence by your
impertinent talking.

5. Be not too earnest, loud, or violent in your conversation. Silence
your opponent with reason, not with noise.

6. Be careful not to interrupt another when he is speaking; hear him out,
and you will understand him the better and be able to give him the better
answer.

7. Consider before you speak, especially, when the business is of moment;
weigh the sense of what you mean to utter, and the expressions you
intend to use, that they may be significant, pertinent, and inoffensive.
Inconsiderate persons do not think till they speak; or they speak, and
then think.

8. Some people excel in husbandry, some in gardening, some in
mathematics. In conversation, learn, as near as you can, where the skill
or excellence of any person lies; put him upon talking on that subject,
observe what he says, keep it in your memory, or commit it to writing.
By this means, you will glean the worth and knowledge of every body you
converse with; and, at an easy rate, acquire what may be of use to you on
many occasions.

9. When you are in company with light, vain, impertinent persons, let
the observing of their failings make you the more cautious, both in
conversation with them and in your general behavior, that you may avoid
their errors.

10. If any one whom you do not know to be a person of truth, sobriety,
and weight, relates strange stories, be not too ready to believe or
report them; and yet unless he is one of your familiar acquaintances, be
not too forward to contradict him.

11. If the occasion requires you to declare your opinion, do it modestly
and gently, not bluntly nor coarsely; by this means, you will avoid
giving offense, or being abused for too much credulity.

[253] HU-MANˊ-I-TY, mankind.

[254] E-QUIVˊ-O-CATE, speak purposely so as to convey a false impression.




XXXI.—THE SISTER OF CHARITY.

GERALD GRIFFIN.


  1. She once was a lady of honor and wealth,
    Bright glowed on her features the roses of health;
    Her vesture was blended of silk and of gold,
    And her motion shook perfume from every fold:
    Joy revelled around her—love shone at her side,
    And gay was her smile, as the glance of a bride;
    And light was her step in the mirth-sounding hall,
    When she heard of the daughters of Vincent de Paul.

  2. She felt, in her spirit, the summons[255] of grace,
    That called her to live for the suffering race;
    And heedless of pleasure, of comfort, of home,
    Rose quickly like Mary, and answered, “I come.”
    She put from her person the trappings[256] of pride,
    And passed from her home, with the joy of a bride,
    Nor wept at the threshold, as onwards she moved—
    For her heart was on fire in the cause it approved.

  3. Lost ever to fashion—to vanity lost,
    That beauty that once was the song and the toast—
    No more in the ball-room that figure we meet,
    But gliding at dusk to the wretch’s retreat,
    Forgot in the halls is that high-sounding name,
    For the Sister of Charity blushes at fame;
    Forgot are the claims of her riches and birth,
    For she barters for heaven the glory of earth.

  4. Those feet, that to music could gracefully move,
    Now bear her alone on the mission of love;
    Those hands that once dangled the perfume and gem,
    Are tending[257] the helpless, or lifted for them;
    That voice that once echoed the song of the vain.
    Now whispers relief to the bosom of pain;
    And the hair that was shining with diamond and pearl,
    Is wet with the tears of the penitent girl.

  5. Her down bed—a pallet; her trinkets—a bead;
    Her lustre—one taper that serves her to read;
    Her sculpture—the crucifix nailed by her bed;
    Her paintings—one print of the thorn-crowned head;
    Her cushion—the pavement that wearies her knees;
    Her music—the psalm, or sigh of disease;
    The delicate lady lives mortified[258] there,
    And the feast is forsaken for fasting and prayer.

  6. Yet not to the service of heart and of mind,
    Are the cares of that heaven-minded virgin confined.
    Like him whom she loves, to the mansions of grief
    She hastes with the tidings of joy and relief.
    She strengthens the weary—she comforts the weak,
    And soft is her voice in the ear of the sick;
    Where want and affliction on mortals attend,
    The Sister of Charity _there_ is a friend.

  7. Unshrinking where pestilence scatters his breath,
    Like an angel she moves, ’mid the vapor of death;
    Where rings the loud musket, and flashes the sword,
    Unfearing she walks, for she follows the Lord.
    How sweetly she bends over each plague-tainted face,
    With looks that are lighted with holiest grace;
    How kindly she dresses each suffering limb,
    For she sees in the wounded the image of Him.

  8. Behold her, ye worldly! behold her, ye vain!
    Who shrink from the pathway of virtue and pain;
    Who yield up to pleasure your nights and your days,
    Forgetful of service, forgetful of praise.
    Ye lazy philosophers—self-seeking men,—
    Ye fireside philanthropists, great at the pen,
    How stands in the balance your eloquence weighed
    With the life and the deeds of that high-born maid?

[256] TRAPˊ-PINGS, ornaments.

[257] TENDˊ-ING, attending; keeping.

XXXII.—REPROOF TO AN AFFECTED[259] SPEAKER.

LA BRUYERE.


1. What do you say? _What?_ I _really_ do not understand you. Be so good
as to explain yourself again. Upon my word, I do not. O, _now_ I know!
you mean to tell me it is a cold day. Why did you not say at once: “It
is cold to-day.” If you wish to inform me it rains or snows, pray say:
“It rains,” “it snows;” or, if you think I look well, and you choose to
compliment[260] me, say, “I think you look well.”

2. “But,” you answer, “that is so common, and so plain, and what every
body can say.” Well, and what if they can? Is it so great a misfortune to
be understood when one speaks, and to speak like the rest of the world?
I will tell you what, my friend; you and your fine-spoken brethren want
_one_ thing—you do not suspect[261] it, and I shall astonish[262] you—you
want _common sense_.

3. Nay, this is not all; you have something _too_ much; you possess an
opinion that you have _more_ sense than others. That is the source of all
your pompous[263] nothings, your cloudy sentences, and your big words
without a meaning. Before you accost[264] a person, or enter a room, let
me pull you by your sleeve, and whisper in your ear: “Do not try to show
off your sense; have none at all; that is your part. Use plain language,
if you can; just such as you find others use, who, in your idea, have no
understanding; and then, perhaps, you will get credit for having some.”

XXXIII.—MY BIRTHDAY.

THOMAS MOORE.


  1. “My birthday!”—what a different sound
      That word had in my youthful ears!
    And how, each time the day comes round,
      Less and less white the mark appears!
    When first our scanty years are told,
      It seems like pastime to grow old;
    And, as youth counts the shining links
      That Time around him binds so fast,
    Pleased with the task, he little thinks
      How hard that chain will press, at last.

  2. Vain was the man, and false as vain,
      Who said: “Were he ordained[265] to run
    His long career[266] of life again,
      He _would do_ all that he _had done_.”
    Ah! ’tis not thus the voice that dwells
      In sober birthdays, speaks to me;
    Far otherwise—of time it tells
      Lavished[267] unwisely, carelessly,
    Of counsel mocked—of talents made,
      Haply,[268] for high and pure designs,
    But oft, like Israel’s incense, laid
      Upon unholy, earthly shrines,
    Of nursing many a wrong desire,
      Of wandering after Love too far,
    And taking every meteor fire
      That crossed my path-way, for his star!

  3. All this it tells, and I could trace[269]
      The imperfect picture o’er again,
    With power to add, retouch,[270] efface[271]
      The lights and shades, the joy and pain,
      How little of the past would stay!
      How quickly all should melt away,
    _All_—but that freedom of the mind,
      Which hath been more than wealth to me;
    Those friendships in my boyhood twined,[272]
      And kept till now unchangingly.[273]
    And that dear home, that saving ark,
      Where love’s true light at last, I’ve found,
    Cheering within when all grows dark,
      And comfortless, and storm around.

XXXIV.—LABOR.

FRANCES OSGOOD.


  1. Pause not to dream of the future before us;
    Pause not to weep the wild cares that come o’er us;
    Hark! how creation’s deep musical chorus,[274]
      Unintermitting,[275] goes up into Heaven!
    Never the ocean-wave falters[276] in flowing,
    Never the little seed stops in its growing,
    More and more richly the rose-hart keeps glowing,
      Till from its nourishing stem it is riven.[277]

  2. “Labor is worship!”—the robin is singing;
    “Labor is worship!”—the wild bee is ringing;
    Listen! that eloquent whisper upspringing,
      Speaks to thy soul from out nature’s heart.
    From the dark cloud flows the life-giving shower;
    From the rough sod comes the soft-breathing flower;
      From the small insect, the rich coral bower;
      Only man, in the plan, ever shrinks from his part.

  3. Labor is life!—’Tis the still water faileth;
    Idleness ever despaireth, bewaileth[278],
    Keep the watch wound; for the dark dust assaileth[279]
      Flowers droop and die in the stillness of noon.
    Labor is glory!—the flying cloud lightens;
    Only the waving wing changes and brightens;
    Idle hearts only the dark future frightens;
      Play the sweet keys, wouldst thou keep them in tune.

  4. Labor is rest—from the sorrows that greet us;
    Rest from all petty vexations[280] that meet us;
    Rest from sin-promptings[281] that ever entreat us;
      Rest from world Sirens[282] that lead us to ill.
    Work—and pure slumbers shall wait on thy pillow;
    Work—thou shalt ride o’er care’s coming billow;
    Lie not down wearied ’neath woe’s weeping willow:
      Work with a stout heart and resolute[283] will.

  5. Droop not, though shame, sin, and anguish[284] are round thee;
    Bravely fling off the cold chain that hath bound thee;
    Look on yon pure heaven smiling beyond thee;
      Rest not content in thy darkness,—a clod.[285]
    Work for some good,—be it ever so slowly;
    Cherish some flower,—be it ever so lowly;
    Labor!—all labor is noble and holy;
      Let thy great deeds be a prayer to thy God.

XXXV.—OUR MISERIES OFTEN OUR FAULT.

BLAIR.


1. We find man placed in a world, where he has, by no means, the disposal
of the events that happen. Calamities[286] sometimes befall the worthiest
and the best, which it is not in their power to prevent, and where
nothing is left them, but to acknowledge and to submit to the high hand
of Heaven. For such visitations of trial, many good and wise reasons can
be assigned[287], which the present subject leads me not to discuss.[288]

2. But, though those unavoidable[289] calamities make a part, yet they
make not the chief part, of the vexations and sorrows that distress human
life. A multitude of evils beset[290] us, for the source of which we must
look to another quarter. No sooner has any thing in the health or in the
circumstances of men, gone cross[291] to their wish, than they begin to
talk of the unequal distribution[292] of the good things of this life;
they envy the condition of others; they repine[293] at their own lot, and
fret against the Ruler of the world.

3. Full of these sentiments, one man pines under a broken
constitution.[294] But let us ask him, whether he can fairly and honestly
assign no cause for this but the unknown decree of Heaven? Has he duly
valued the blessing of health, and always observed the rules of virtue
and sobriety?[295] Has he been moderate in his life, and temperate in all
his pleasures? If now he is only paying the price of his former, perhaps,
his forgotten indulgences, has he any right to complain, as if he were
suffering unjustly?

4. Were we to survey the chambers of sickness and distress, we should
often find them peopled with the victims of intemperance and sensuality,
and with the vicious children of indolence and sloth. Among the
thousands who languish there, we should find the proportion of innocent
sufferers to be small. We should see faded youth premature[296] old age,
and the prospect of an untimely grave, to be the portion of multitudes
who, in one way or other, have brought those evils on themselves; while
yet these martyrs of vice and folly have the assurance to arraign[297]
the hard fate of man, and to “fret against the Lord.”

5. But you, perhaps, complain of hardships of another kind; of the
injustice of the world; of the poverty which you suffer, and the
discouragements under which you labor; of the crosses and disappointments
of which your life has been doomed to be full. Before you give too much
scope to your discontent, let me desire you to reflect impartially
upon your past train of life. Have not sloth, or pride, or ill-temper,
or sinful passions, misled you often from the path of sound and wise
conduct? Have you not been wanting to yourselves in improving those
opportunities which Providence offered you, for bettering and advancing
your state?

6. If you have chosen to indulge your humor or your taste, in the
gratifications[298] of indolence and pleasure, can you complain because
others, in preference to you, have obtained those advantages which
naturally belong to useful labors and honorable pursuits. Have not
the consequences of some false steps, into which your passions, or
your pleasures, have betrayed you, pursued you through much of your
life; tainted[299], perhaps, your character, involved[300] you in
embarrassments[301], or sunk you into neglect?

7. It is an old saying, that every man is the artificer[302] of his own
fortune in the world. It is certain, that the world seldom turns wholly
against a man, unless through his own fault. “Religion is,” in general,
“profitable unto all things.” Virtue, diligence, and industry, joined
with good temper and prudence, have ever been found the surest road to
prosperity; and, where men fail of attaining it, their want of success is
far oftener owing to their having deviated from that road, than to their
having encountered insuperable barriers in it.

8. Some by being too artful, forfeit the reputation of probity. Some,
by being too open, are accounted to fail in prudence. Others, by being
fickle and changeable, are distrusted by all. The case commonly is, that
men seek to ascribe their disappointments to any cause, rather than to
their own misconduct; and, when they can devise no other cause, they lay
them to the charge of Providence. Their folly leads them into vices;
their vices into misfortunes; and, in their misfortunes, they “murmur
against Providence.”

9. They are doubly unjust toward their Creator. In their prosperity, they
are apt to ascribe their success to their own diligence, rather than to
His blessing; and, in their adversity, they impute their distresses to
His providence, not to their own misbehavior. Whereas, the truth is the
very reverse of this. Every good gift and every perfect gift cometh from
above; and of evil and misery, man is the author to himself.

XXXVI.—TRUE PATRIOTISM.[303]

SIR WILLIAM JONES.


  1. What constitutes[304] a State?
      Not high raised battlements[305] or labored mound,[306]
    Thick wall or moated[307] gate;
      Nor cities proud, with spires and turrets[308] crowned;
    Not bays and broad-armed ports,
      Where, laughing at the storm, rich navies[309] ride;
    Not starred and spangled courts,
      Where low-browed baseness[310] wafts perfume to pride.

  2. No; men, high-minded[311] men,
      With powers as far above dull brutes endued[312],
    In forest brake, or den,
      As beasts excel[313] cold rocks and brambles[314] rude;

      But know their rights, and knowing, dare maintain;[315]
    Prevent the long aimed blow,
      And crush the tyrant while they rend[316] the chain;
    _These_ constitute a State;
      And Sovereign[317] Law, that State’s collected[318] will,

      Sits empress, crowning good, repressing[320] ill.

  Sir Archibald Alison, although not himself a Catholic, eloquently
  sets forth, in the following lesson, the refining and civilizing
  influences of the Catholic Church.


1. What is it, then, which has wrought so surprising a change in
the manners and habits of Europe, of the inhabitants of the great
mountain-girdle of the earth? What is it which has spread cultivation
through wastes deemed, in ancient times, inaccessible[321] to
improvement, and humanized[322] the manners of a people, remarkable only,
under the Roman sway, for the ferocity and barbarism of their customs?

2. What but the influence of religion; of that faith which has calmed the
savage passions of the human mind, and spread its beneficial influence
amongst the remotest[323] habitations of men, and which prompted its
disciples to leave the luxuries and comforts of southern civilization
to diffuse[324] knowledge and humanity through inhospitable realms, and
spread, even amidst the regions of desolation, the light of knowledge,
and the blessings of Christianity.

3. Impressed with these ideas, the traveler, in crossing the St. Bernard,
and comparing the perfect safety with which he now can explore the most
solitary parts of these mountains, with the perils[325] of the passage,
attested by votive[326] offerings, even in the days of Adrian, and the
Antonines, will think with thankfulness of the religion by which this
wonderful change has been effected, and with veneration of the saint
whose name has, for a thousand years, been affixed to the pass where his
influence first reclaimed the people from their barbarous life; and in
crossing the defile of Mount Brenner, where the Abbey of Wilten first
offered an asylum to the pilgrim, he will feel, with a late amiable and
eloquent writer, “how fortunate it is that religion has penetrated these
fastnesses, impervious[327] to human power, and, where precautions are
impossible and resistance useless, spread her invisible ægis[328] over
the traveler, and conducts him, secure under her protection, through all
the dangers of his way!”

4. When in such situations he reflects upon his security, and recollects
that these mountains, so savage, and so well adapted to the progress of
murderers and banditti[329], have not in the memory of man been stained
with human blood, he ought to do justice to the cause, and gratefully to
acknowledge the influence of religion.

5. Impressed with these ideas, he will behold with interest the crosses
which frequently mark the brow of a precipice, and the little chapels
hollowed out of the rock, where the road is narrowed; he will consider
them as so many pledges of security, and rest assured, that so long as
the pious mountaineer continues to adore the “Good Shepherd,” and to
implore the power of the “Afflicted Mother,” he will never cease to
befriend the traveler, nor to discharge the duties of hospitality.

XXXVIII.—HYMN OF THE MOUNTAINEERS.

MRS. HEMANS.

  Mrs. Felicia Dorothea Hemans was born in England in 1794, and
  died in 1835. Her poetry is not only remarkable for purity and
  delicacy of feeling, but is often marked by ardent and vigorous
  expression.


  1. For the strength of the hills we bless thee, our God, our fathers’
        God!
  Thou hast made Thy children mighty, by the touch of the mountain sod.
  Thou hast fixed our ark of refuge[330] where the spoiler’s foot ne’er
        trod;
  For the strength of the hills we bless Thee, our God, our fathers’ God!

  2. We are watchers of a beacon[331] whose light must never die;
  We are guardians of an altar midst the silence of the sky,
  The rocks yield founts of courage, struck forth as by Thy rod;
  For the strength of the hills we bless Thee, our God, our father’s God.

  3. For the dark-resounding caverns,[332] where Thy still, small voice is
        heard;
  For the strong pines of the forests, that by Thy breath is stirred;
  For the storms on whose free pinions[333] Thy spirit walks abroad;
  For the strength of the hills we bless Thee, our God, our fathers’ God!

  4. The royal eagle darteth on his quarry[334] from the heights,
  And the stag, that knows no master, seeks there his wild delights;
  But we, for _Thy_ communion, have sought the mountain sod;
  For the strength of the hills we bless Thee, our God, our fathers’ God!

  5. The banner of the chieftain far, far below us waves;
  The war-horse of the spearman cannot reach our lofty caves;
  Thy dark clouds wrap the threshold of Freedom’s last abode;
  For the strength of the hills we bless Thee, our God, our fathers’ God!

  6. For the shadow of Thy presence, round our camp of rock outspread;
  For the stern defiles of battle, bearing record of our dead;
  For the snows and for the torrents, for the free heart’s burial sod;
  For the strength of the hills, we bless Thee, our God, our fathers’ God!

[330] REFˊ-UGE, shelter, or protection from danger.

[331] BEAˊ-CON, a signal, or mark to give warning of danger.

[332] CAVˊ-ERN, a deep hollow place in the earth.

[333] PINˊ-IONS, wings.

[334] QUARˊ-RY, the game which a hawk or an eagle is pursuing, or has
killed.




XXXIX.—EXHORTATION TO PRAYER.


  1. Not on a prayerless bed, not on a prayerless bed
      Compose thy weary limbs to rest;
        For they alone are blessed
                  With balmy sleep,
                  Whom angels keep;
              Nor, though by care oppressed,
                  Or anxious sorrow,
          Or thought in many a coil perplexed
                  For coming morrow,
                  Lay not thy head
                  On prayerless bed.

  2. For who can tell, when sleep thine eyes shall close,
      That earthly cares and woes
          To thee may e’er return?
                  Arouse, my soul,
                  Slumber control,
              And let thy lamp burn brightly;
              So shall thine eyes discern
            Things pure and sightly;
              Taught by the Spirit, learn
              Never on thoughtless bed
              To lay thine unblessed head.

  3. Hast thou no pining want, or wish, or care,
      That calls for holy prayer?
          Has thy day been so bright
          That in its flight
      There is no trace of sorrow?
      And art thou sure to-morrow
          Will be like this, and more
      Abundant? Dost thou yet lay up thy store,
            And still make plans for more?
            Thou fool! this very night
            Thy soul may wing its flight.

  4. Hast thou no being than thyself more dear,
          That plows the ocean deep?
    And when storms sweep the wintry, lowering skies,
          For whom thou wakest and weepest?
          O, when thy pangs are deepest,
    Seek then the covenant ark of prayer,
    For He that slumbereth not, is there,
    His ear is open to thy cry;
            O, then, on prayerless bed
            Lay not thy thoughtless head.

  5. Arouse thee, weary soul, nor yield to slumber,
      Till in communion blessed
          With the elect thou rest,
      Those souls in countless number;
          And with them raise
          The note of praise,
      Reaching from earth to heaven;
          Chosen, redeemed, forgiven;
          So lay thy happy head,
          Prayer-crowned, on blessed bed.




XL.—BEHIND TIME.

FREEMAN HUNT.


1. A railroad train was rushing along at almost lightning speed. A curve
was just ahead, beyond which was a station at which the cars usually
passed each other. The conductor was late, so late that the period during
which the down train was to wait had nearly elapsed; but he hoped yet
to pass the curve safely. Suddenly a locomotive dashed into sight right
ahead. In an instant there was a collision. A shriek, a shock, and fifty
souls were in eternity; and all because an engineer had been _behind
time_.

2. A great battle was going on. Column[335] after column had been
precipitated for eight mortal hours on the enemy posted along the ridge
of a hill. The summer sun was sinking to the west; rëenforcements[336]
for the obstinate defenders were already in sight; it was necessary to
carry the position with one final charge, or every thing would be lost.

3. A powerful corps had been summoned from across the country, and if it
came up in season all would yet be well. The great conqueror, confident
in its arrival, formed his reserve[337] into an attacking column, and
ordered them to charge the enemy. The whole world knows the result.
Grouchy[338] failed to appear; the imperial guard was beaten back;
Waterloo was lost. Napoleon died a prisoner at St. Helena because one of
his marshals was _behind time_.

4. A leading firm in commercial circles had long struggled against
bankruptcy. As it had enormous assets[339] in California, it expected
remittances by a certain day, and if the sums promised arrived, its
credit, honor, and its future prosperity would be preserved. But week
after week elapsed without bringing the gold. At last came the fatal
day on which the firm had bills maturing[340] to enormous amounts. The
steamer was telegraphed at daybreak; but it was found, on inquiry, that
she brought no funds, and the house failed. The next arrival brought
nearly half a million to the insolvents[341], but it was too late; they
were ruined because their agent, in remitting, had been _behind time_.

5. A condemned man was led out for execution. He had taken human
life, but under circumstances of the greatest provocation, and public
sympathy was active in his behalf. Thousands had signed petitions for a
reprieve[342], a favorable answer had been expected the night before, and
though it had not come, even the sheriff felt confident that it would
yet arrive in season. Thus the morning passed without the appearance of
the messenger. The last moment was up. The prisoner took his place on
the drop, the cap was drawn over his eyes, the bolt was drawn, and a
lifeless body swung revolving in the wind. Just at that moment a horseman
came into sight, galloping down hill, his steed covered with foam. He
carried a packet in his right hand, which he waved rapidly to the crowd.
He was the express rider with a reprieve. But he had come too late. A
comparatively innocent man had died an ignominious death, because a watch
had been five minutes too slow, making its bearer arrive _behind time_.

6. It is continually so in life. The best laid plans, the most important
affairs, the fortunes of individuals, the weal of nations, honor,
happiness, life itself, are daily sacrificed because somebody is “behind
time.” There are men who always fail in whatever they undertake, simply
because they are “behind time.” There are others who put off reformation
year by year, till death seizes them, and they perish unrepentant,
because forever “behind time.” Five minutes in a crisis is worth years.
It is but a little period, yet it has often saved a fortune or redeemed
a people. If there is one virtue that should be cultivated more than
another by him who would succeed in life, it is punctuality; if there is
one error that should be avoided it is being _behind time_.

[336] RE-EN-FORCEˊ-MENTS, supplies of additional troops.

[337] RE-SERVEˊ, a select body of troops kept in the rear of an army in
action, to give support when required.

[338] Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France, was defeated by the Allies
under the Duke of Wellington, at Waterloo, June 18, 1815. Marshal Grouchy
was expected to aid the emperor with a body of troops, but failed to
appear.

[339] ASˊ-SETS, property or effects.

[340] MA-TURˊ-ING, ripening, coming to a perfected state. Bills or notes

XLI.—EVIL INFLUENCE OF SKEPTICISM.

CAMPBELL.

  Thomas Campbell was born in Scotland in 1777, and died in 1844.
  Some of his shorter poems are remarkable for pathos and beauty,
  such as “O’Connor’s Child,” “The Exile of Erin,” etc.


  1. O, lives there, Heaven! beneath thy dread expanse,
    One hopeless, dark idolater of Chance,
    Content to feed, with pleasures unrefined,
    The lukewarm passions of a lowly mind;
    Who, mouldering earthward, reft[343] of every trust,
    In joyless union wedded to the dust,
    Could all his parting energy dismiss,
    And call this barren world sufficient bliss?

  2. There live, alas! of heaven-directed mien,
    Of cultured soul, and sapient[344] eye serene,
    Who hail thee, Man! the pilgrim of a day,
    Spouse of the worm, and brother of the clay!
    Frail as the leaf in Autumn’s yellow bower,
    Dust in the wind, or dew upon the flower!
    A friendless slave, a child without a sire,
    Whose mortal life, and momentary fire,
    Lights to the grave his chance-created form,
    As ocean-wrecks illuminate the storm;
    And, when the gun’s tremendous flash is o’er,
    To night and silence sink for evermore!

  3. Are these the pompous tidings ye proclaim,
    Lights of the world, and demigods[345] of Fame?
    Is this your triumph, this your proud applause,
    Children of Truth, and champions of her cause?
    For this hath Science searched, on weary wing,
    By shore and sea, each mute and living thing?
    Launched with Iberia’s[346] pilot from the steep,
    To world’s unknown, and isles beyond the deep?
    Or round the cope[347] her living chariot driven,
    And wheeled in triumph through the signs of heaven?
    O, star-eyed Science, hast thou wandered there,
    To waft us home the message of despair?
    Then bind the palm, thy sage’s brow to suit,
    Of blasted leaf, and death distilling fruit!

  4. Ah me! the laureled wreath that Murder rears,
    Blood-nursed, and watered by the widow’s tears,
    Seems not so foul, so tainted, and so dread,
    As waves the night-shade[348] round the sceptic head.
    What is the bigot’s torch, the tyrant’s chain?
    I smile on death, if heavenward Hope remain!
    But, if the warring winds of Nature’s strife
    Be all the faithless charter of my life,
    If chance awaked, inexorable power!
    This frail and feverish being of an hour,
    Doomed o’er the world’s precarious scene to sweep,
    Swift as the tempest travels on the deep,
    To know Delight but by her parting smile,
    And toil, and wish, and weep, a little while;
    Then melt, ye elements, that formed in vain
    This troubled pulse, and visionary[349] brain!
    Fade, ye wild flowers, memorials of my doom!
    And sink, ye stars, that light me to the tomb!

  5. Truth, ever lovely, since the world began,
    The foe of tyrants, and the friend of man,
    How can thy words from balmy slumber start
    Reposing Virtue, pillowed on the heart!
    Yet, if thy voice the note of thunder rolled,
    And that were true which Nature never told,
    Let Wisdom smile not on her conquered field
    No rapture dawns, no treasure is revealed!
    O, let her read, nor loudly, nor elate,
    The doom that bars us from a better fate!
    But, sad as angels for the good mans sin,
    Weep to record, and blush to give it in!

[343] REFT, bereft; deprived.

[344] SAˊ-PI-ENT, wise.

[345] DEMˊ-I-GOD, a deified hero.

[346] I-BEˊ-RI-A’S PIˊ-LOT, Columbus. Iberia is an ancient name of Spain.

[347] COPE, the concave of the sky, an arch or vault over head.

[348] NIGHTˊ-SHADE, a noxious plant.

[349] VIˊ-SION-A-RY, prone to see or capable of seeing visions;
imaginative.




XLII.—DAVID’S LAMENT FOR ABSALOM.

WILLIS.


  1. Alas, my noble boy! that thou shouldst die!
      Thou, who wert made so beautifully fair!
    That death should settle in thy glorious eye,
      And leave his stillness in this clustering hair!
    How could he mark thee for the silent tomb,
        My proud boy, Absalom!

  2. Cold is thy brow, my son! and I am chill
      As to my bosom I have tried to press thee.
    How was I wont to feel my pulses thrill,
      Like a rich harpstring, yearning[350] to caress thee,
    And hear thy sweet “_My father!_” from these dumb
        And cold lips, Absalom!

  3. But death is on thee. I shall hear the gush
      Of music, and the voices of the young;
    And life will pass me in the mantling[351] blush,
      And the dark tresses to the soft winds flung;—
    But thou no more, with thy sweet voice, shalt come
        To meet me, Absalom!

  4. And, O, when I am stricken, and my heart,
      Like a bruised reed, is waiting to be broken,
    How will its love for thee, as I depart,
      Yearn for thine ear to drink its last deep token!
    It were so sweet, amid death’s gathering gloom,
        To see thee, Absalom!

  5. And now, farewell! ’Tis hard to give thee up,
      With death so like a gentle slumber on thee:—
    And thy dark sin!—O, I could drink the cup,
      If from this woe its bitterness had won thee.
    May God have called thee, like a wanderer, home,
        My lost boy, Absalom!

[350] YEARNˊING, strongly desiring.

[351] MANˊTLING, suffusing the face.




XLIII.—A STORM AT SEA.

ARCHBISHOP HUGHES.

  Archbishop Hughes, was born in the north of Ireland in 1798. He
  came to the United States in 1817, with his father, and died
  January 3, 1864. He was educated at Mount St. Mary’s, Emmetsburg,
  Maryland, ordained priest in 1825, became bishop in 1842, and
  archbishop of New York in 1850. He devoted his great energies in
  an especial manner to the encouragement and spread of Catholic
  education. His controversies with Breckenridge, and the debate
  on the Public School question, proved him to be a man of great
  controversial ability.


1. This day I was gratified with what I had often desired to witness—the
condition of the sea in a tempest. I had contemplated the ocean in all
its other phases, and they are almost innumerable. At one time it is
seen reposing in perfect stillness under the blue sky and bright sun.
At another, slightly ruffled, and then its motion causes his rays to
tremble and dance in broken fragments of silvery or golden light,—and
the sight is dazzled by following the track from whence his beams are
reflected,—while all besides seems to frown in the darkness of its ripple.

2. Again it may be seen somewhat more agitated and of a darker hue,
under a clouded sky and a stronger and increasing wind. Then you see an
occasional wave, rising a little above the rest, and crowning its summit
with that crest of white, breaking from its top and tumbling over like
liquid alabaster[352]. I had seen the ocean, too, by moonlight, and as
much of it as may be seen in the darkness, when the moon and stars are
veiled. But until to-day I had never seen it in correspondence with the
TEMPEST.

3. After a breeze of some sixty hours from the north and north-west, the
wind died away about four o’clock yesterday afternoon. The calm continued
till about nine in the evening. The mercury in the barometer[353] fell,
in the mean time, at an extraordinary rate; and the captain predicted
that we should encounter a “gale” from the south-east. The “gale” came
on, at about eleven o’clock; not violent at first, but increasing every
moment. I awoke with a confused recollection of a good deal of rolling
and thumping through the night, which was occasioned by the dashing of
the waves against the ship.

4. Hurrying on my clothes, I found such of the passengers as could stand,
at the doors of the hurricane-house[354], “holding on,” and looking out
in the utmost consternation. It was still quite dark. Four of the sails
were already in ribbons; the winds whistling through the cordage; the
rain dashing furiously and in torrents; the noise and spray scarcely less
than I found them under the great sheet at Niagara. And in the midst of
all this, the captain with his speaking trumpet, the officers, and the
sailors, screaming to each other in efforts to be heard,—this, all this,
in the darkness which precedes the dawning of day, and with the fury of
the hurricane, combined to form as much of the _terribly_ sublime as I
ever wish to witness concentrated in one scene.

5. The passengers, though silent, were filled with apprehension. What the
extent of the danger, and how all this would terminate, were questions
which rose in my own mind, although I was unconscious of fear or
trepidation.[355] But to such questions there are no answers, for this
knowledge resides only with Him who “guides the storm and directs the
whirlwind.” We had encountered, however, as yet, only the commencement
of a gale, whose terrors had been heightened by its suddenness, by
the darkness, and by the confusion. It continued to blow furiously for
twenty-four hours; so that during the whole day I enjoyed a view, which,
apart from its dangers, would be worth a voyage across the Atlantic.

6. The ship was driven madly through the raging waters, and when it was
impossible to walk the decks without imminent risk of being lifted up and
carried away by the winds, the poor sailors were kept aloft, tossing and
swinging about the yards and in the tops, clinging by their bodies, feet,
and arms, with mysterious tenacity, to the spars, while their hands were
employed in taking in and securing sail.

7. On deck the officers and men made themselves safe by ropes; but how
the gallant fellows aloft kept from being blown out of the rigging, was
equally a matter of wonder and admiration. However, about seven o’clock
they had taken in what canvas had not been blown away, except the
sails, by means of which the vessel is kept steady. At nine o’clock the
hurricane had acquired its full force. There was no more work to be done.
The ship lay to[356], and those who had her in charge only remained on
deck to be prepared for whatever of disaster might occur. The breakfast
hour came, and passed, unheeded by most of the passengers.

8. By this time the sea was rolling up its hurricane waves; and that I
might not lose the grandeur of such a view, I fortified myself against
the rain and spray, and, in spite of the fierceness of the gale, planted
myself in a position favorable for a survey of all around me, and in
safety, so long as the ship’s strong works might hold together. I had
often seen paintings of a storm at sea, but here was the original. These
imitations are oftentimes graphic[357] and faithful, as far as they go,
but they are necessarily deficient in accompaniments which paintings
cannot supply, and are therefore feeble and ineffective.

9. You have, upon canvas, the ship and the sea, but, as they come from
the hands of the artist, so they remain. The universal _motion_ of both
is thus arrested and made stationary. There is no subject in which
the pencil of the painter acknowledges more its indebtedness to the
imagination than in its attempts to delineate[358] the sea storm.

10. It was not the least remarkable, and by far the most comfortable
circumstance in this combination of all that is grand and terrible, that,
furious as were the winds, towering and threatening as were the billows,
our glorious bark preserved her equilibrium[359] against the fury of the
one, and her buoyancy in despite of the alternate precipice and avalanche
of the other. True it is, she was made to whistle through her cordage, to
creak and moan through all her timbers, even to her masts. True it is,
she was made to plunge and rear, to tremble and reel and stagger. Still,
she continued to scale the watery mountain, and ride on its very summit,
until, as it rolled onward from beneath her, she descended gently on her
pathway, ready to triumph again and again over each succeeding wave.

11. At such a moment it was a matter of profound deliberation which most
to admire, the majesty of God in the winds and waves or His goodness
and wisdom in enabling His creatures to contend with and overcome the
elements even in the fierceness of their anger! To cast one’s eye abroad
on the scene that surrounded me at this moment, and to think man should
have said to himself, “I will build myself an ark in the midst of you,
and ye shall not prevent my passage; nay, ye indomitable waves shall bear
me up, and ye winds shall waft me onward!” And yet there we were in the
fullness of this fearful experiment.

12. I had never believed it possible for a vessel to encounter such a
hurricane without being dashed or torn to pieces, at least in all her
masts and rigging; for I am persuaded that had the same tempest passed as
furiously over your town, during the same length of time, it would have
left scarcely a house standing. The yielding character of the element
in which the vessel is launched is the great secret of safety on such
occasions. Hence, when gales occur upon the wide ocean, there is little
danger; but when they drive you upon breakers on a lee shore[360], where
the keel[361] comes in contact with “the too solid earth,” then it is
impossible to escape shipwreck.

13. I never experienced a sensation of fear on the ocean; but this
tempest has increased my confidence tenfold, not only in the sea but in
the ship. It no longer surprises me that few vessels are lost at sea,
for they and their element are made for each other. And the practical
conclusion from this experience of a gale is encouraging for all my
future navigation. I shall have confidence in my ship now, as I have
ever had in the sea. Ever since my eyes first rested on the ocean, I
have cherished an instinctive affection for it, as if it were something
capable of sympathy and benevolence. When calm, it is to me a slumbering
infant. How tranquilly it sleeps!

XLIV.—THE ATMOSPHERE.


1. The atmosphere rises above us, with its cathedral[362]-dome, arching
towards the heavens, of which it is the most familiar synonym[363] and
symbol. It floats around us like that grand object which the apostle
John saw in his vision—“a sea of glass like unto crystal.” So massive
is it, that, when it begins to stir, it tosses about great ships like
playthings, and sweeps cities and forests to destruction before it. And
yet it is so mobile[364], that we live years in it before we can be
persuaded that it exists at all; and the great bulk of mankind never
realize the truth that they are bathed in an ocean of air. Its weight is
so enormous that iron shivers before it like glass; yet a soap bubble
sails through it with impunity, and the tiniest insect waves it aside
with its wing.

2. It ministers lavishly to all the senses. We touch it not; but it
touches us. Its warm south wind brings back color to the pale face of the
invalid; its cool west winds refresh the fevered brow, and make the blood
mantle in our cheeks; even its northern blasts brace into new vigor the
hardy children of our rugged clime.

3. The eye is indebted to it for all the magnificence of sunrise,
the full brightness of midday, the chastened[365] radiance of the
“gloaming[366],” and the “clouds that cradle near the setting sun.” But
for it the rainbow would want its “triumphal arch,” and the winds would
not send their fleecy messengers on errands round the heavens. The cold
weather would not shed its snow feathers on the earth, nor would drops
of dew gather on the flowers. The kindly rain would never fall, nor
hailstorm, nor fog diversify[367] the face of the sky. Our naked globe
would turn its tanned and unshadowed forehead to the sun, and one dreary,
monotonous blaze of light and heat dazzle and burn up all things.

4. Were there no atmosphere, the evening sun would in a moment set, and
without warning plunge the earth in darkness. But the air keeps in her
hand a sheaf of his rays, and lets them slip slowly through her fingers;
so that the shadows of evening gather by degrees, and the flowers have
time to bow their heads, and each creature space to find a place of rest,
and nestle to repose. In the morning, the gairish[368] sun would at once
burst from the bosom of night, and blaze above the horizon; but the air
watches for his coming, and sends at first one little ray to announce his
approach, and then another, and by and by a handful; and so gently draws
aside the curtain of night, and slowly lets the light fall on the face
of the sleeping earth, till her eyelids open, and, like man, she “goeth
forth again to her labor till the evening.”

[362] CA-THEˊ-DRAL, a large church, the term is properly applied to the
church in which the bishop of the diocese usually officiates.

[363] SYNˊ-O-NYM, one of two or more words having the same or a similar
meaning.

[364] MOBˊ-ILE, movable, light.

[365] CHASTˊ-ENED (chaˊ-snd), pure.

XLV.—THE CHERWELL WATER-LILY.

FABER.


  1. How often doth a wild flower bring
    Fancies and thoughts that seem to spring
      From inmost depths of feeling!
    Nay, often they have power to bless
    With their uncultured loveliness,
    And far into the aching breast
    There goes a heavenly thought of rest
      With their soft influence stealing.
    How often, too, can ye unlock,
    Dear wild flowers, with a gentle shock,
      The wells of holy tears!
    While somewhat of a Christian light
    Breaks sweetly on the mourner’s sight,
      To calm unquiet fears!
    Ah! surely such strange power is given
    To lowly flowers like dew from heaven;
    For lessons oft by them are brought,
    Deeper than mortal sage hath taught,
    Lessons of wisdom pure, that rise
    From some clear fountains in the skies.

  2. Fairest of Flora’s lovely daughters
    That bloom by stilly running waters,
    Fair lily! thou a type must be
    Of virgin love and purity!
    Fragrant thou art as any flower,
    That decks a lady’s garden-bower.
    But he who would thy sweetness know
    Must stoop and bend his loving brow
    To catch thy scent, so faint and rare,
    Scarce breathed upon the summer air.
    And all thy motions, too, how free,
    And yet how fraught with sympathy!
    So pale thy tint, so meek thy gleam,
    Shed on thy kindly father-stream!
    Still, as he swayeth to and fro,
      How true in all thy goings,
    As if thy very soul did know
      The secrets of his flowings.

  3. And then that heart of living gold,
    Which thou dost modestly infold,
    And screen from man’s too searching view,
    Within thy robe of snowy hue!
    To careless man thou seem’st to roam
      Abroad upon the river,
    In all thy movements chain’d to home,
      Fast-rooted there forever:
    Link’d by a holy, hidden tie,
    Too subtle for a mortal eye,
    Nor riveted by mortal art,
    Deep down within thy father’s heart.

  4. Emblem in truth thou art to me
    Of all a daughter ought to be!
    How shall I liken thee, sweet flower,
    That other men may feel thy power,
    May seek thee on some lovely night,
    And say how strong, how chaste the might,
      The tie of filial duty,
    How graceful, too, and angel bright,
      The pride of lowly beauty!
    Thou sittest on the varying tide
    As if thy spirit did preside,
    With a becoming, queenly grace,
    As mistress of this lonely place:
    A quiet magic hast thou now
    To smooth the river’s ruffled brow,
      And calm his rippling water,
    And yet, so delicate and airy,
    Thou art to him a very fairy.
      A widowed father’s only daughter.




XLVI.—DISCRETION.

ADDISON.


1. There are many more shining qualities in the mind of man, but there
is none so useful as discretion[369]; it is this indeed, which gives a
value to all the rest, which sets them at work in their proper times and
places, and turns them to the advantage of the person who is possessed
of them. Though a man has all other perfections, and wants this one, he
will be of no great consequence in the world; but if he has this single
talent in perfection, and but a common share of others, he may do what he
pleases in his particular station of life. At the same time that I think
discretion is the most useful talent a man can be master of, I look upon
cunning to be the accomplishment[370] of little, mean, ungenerous minds.

2. Discretion points out the noblest ends to us, and pursues the most
proper and laudable means of attaining[371] them; cunning has only
private, selfish aims, and sticks at nothing which may make them succeed.
Discretion has large and extended views, and, like a well formed eye,
commands a whole horizon;[4] cunning is a sort of short-sightedness that
discovers the minutest objects which are near at hand, but is not able
to discern things at a distance.

3. Discretion, the more it is discovered, gives a greater authority to
the person who possesses it; cunning, when it is once detected, loses
its force, and makes a man incapable of bringing about those events
which he might have done had he passed only for a plain man. Discretion
is the perfection of reason, and a guide to us in all the duties of
life: cunning is a kind of instinct that only looks after our immediate
interest and welfare.

4. Discretion is only found in men of strong sense and good
understanding: cunning is often to be met with in brutes themselves, and
in persons who are but the fewest removes from them. In short cunning is
only the mimic[372] of discretion, and may pass upon weak men, in the
same manner as vivacity is often mistaken for wit, and gravity for wisdom.

5. The cast of mind which is natural to a discreet man, makes him look
forward into futurity, and consider what will be his condition millions
of ages hence, as well as what it is at present. He knows that the misery
or happiness which is reserved for him in another world, loses nothing of
its reality by being placed at so great a distance from him. The objects
do not appear little to him because they are remote.[373] He considers
that those pleasures and pains which lie hid in eternity, approach nearer
to him every moment, and will be present with him in their full weight
and measure, as much as those pains and pleasures which he feels at this
very instant.

6. For this reason, he is careful to secure to himself that which is
the proper business of his nature, and the ultimate[374] design of
his being. He carries his thoughts to the end of every action, and
considers the most distant as well as the most immediate effects of it.
He supersedes[375] every little prospect of gain and advantage which
offers itself here, if he does not find it consistent with the views of a
hereafter. In a word, his hopes are full of immortality, his schemes are
large and glorious, and his conduct suitable to one who knows his true
interest, and how to pursue it by proper methods.

7. I have, in this essay upon discretion, considered it both as an
accomplishment and as a virtue, and have therefore described it in its
full extent, not only as it is the guide of a mortal creature, but as it
is in general the director of a reasonable being. It is in this light
that discretion is represented by the wise man, who sometimes mentions
it under the name of discretion, and sometimes under that of wisdom. It
is, indeed, as described in the latter part of this paper, the greatest
wisdom, but, at the same time, in the power of every one to attain. Its
advantages are infinite, but its acquisition[376] is easy.

XLVII.—STABILITY OF CHARACTER.

ALISON.


1. Stability[377] of character is, in all pursuits, the surest foundation
of success. It is a common error of the indolent[378] and the imprudent
to attribute the success of others to some peculiar talents, or original
superiority of mind, which is not to be found in the generality of men.
Of the falseness of this opinion, the slightest observation of human life
may satisfy us. The difference of talents, indeed, and the varieties
of original character, may produce a difference in the aims and in the
designs of men; and superior minds will naturally form to themselves
superior objects of ambition. But the attainment of these ends, the
accomplishment of these designs, is, in all cases, the consequence of one
means alone—that of steadfastness and perseverance in pursuit.

2. “It is the hand of the diligent,” saith the wise man, “that maketh
rich.” It is the same diligence, when directed to other ends, that
maketh great. Every thing which we see with admiration in the world
around us, or of which we read with delight in the annals of history—the
acquisitions of knowledge, the discoveries of science, the powers of
art, the glories of arms, the dignities of private, or the splendors of
public virtue—all have sprung from the same fountain of mind, from that
steady but unseen perseverance which has been exerted in their pursuit.
The possession of genius alone, is, alas! no certain herald of success;
and how many melancholy instances has the world afforded to us all, of
how little avail mere natural talents are to the prosperity of their
possessors, and of the frequency with which they have led to ruin and
disgrace, when unaccompanied with firmness and energy of mind!

3. This stability of character is the surest promise of honor. It
supposes, indeed, all the qualities of mind that are regarded by the
world with respect; and which constitute the honorable and dignified in
human character. It supposes that profound[379] sense of duty, which
we every where look for as the foundation of virtue, and for the want
of which no other attainments can ever compensate.[380] It supposes a
chastened and regulated imagination, which looks ever to “the things
that are excellent,” and which is incapable of being diverted from
their pursuit, either by the intoxications[381] of prosperous, or the
depressions of adverse fortune. It supposes, still more, a firm and
intrepid[382] heart, which neither pleasure has been able to seduce, nor
indolence to enervate,[383] nor danger to intimidate,[384] and which,
in many a scene of trial, and under many severities of discipline, has
hardened itself at last into the firmness and consistency of virtue.

4. A character of this kind can never be looked upon without admiration;
and wherever we meet it, whether amid the splendors of prosperity, or
the severities of adversity, we feel ourselves disposed to pay it a
pure and an unbidden homage.[385] The display of wild and unregulated
talents may sometimes, indeed, excite a temporary admiration; but it
is the admiration we pay to the useless glare of the meteor, which is
extinguished while it is beheld; while the sentiment we feel for the
steady course of principled virtue, is the admiration with which we
regard the majestic path of the sun, as he slowly pursues his way, to
give light and life to nature.

5. This stability of character is, in another view, the surest foundation
of happiness. There are, doubtless, many ways in which our happiness is
dependent upon the conduct and the sentiments of others; but the great
and perennial[386] source of every man’s happiness is in his own bosom—in
that secret fountain of the heart, from which the “waters of joy or of
bitterness” perpetually flow.

6. It is from this source, the man of steadfast and persevering virtue
derives his peculiar happiness; and the slightest recurrence to our own
experience, can tell us both its nature and its degree. It is pleasing,
we all know, to review the day that is past, and to think that its duties
have been done; to think that the purpose with which we rose, has been
accomplished; that in the busy scene which surrounds us, we have done our
part, and that no temptation has been able to subdue our firmness and our
resolution.

7. Such are the sentiments with which, in every year of life, and still
more in that solemn moment when life is drawing to its close, the man
of persevering virtue is able to review the time that is past. It lies
before him, as it were, in order and regularity; and, while he travels,
over again, the various stages of his progress, memory restores to him
many images to soothe and to animate his heart. The days of trial are
past; the hardships he has suffered, the labors he has undergone, are
remembered no more, but his good deeds remain, and from the grave of time
seem to rise up again to bless him, and to speak to him of peace and hope.

8. Such are, then, the consequences of firmness and stability of
character; and such the rewards which he may look for, who, solemnly
devoting himself to the discharge of the duties of that station or
condition which Providence has assigned him, pursues them with steady and
undeviating labor. It is the character which unites all that is valuable
or noble in human life, the tranquillity of conscience, the honors of
wisdom, and the dignity of virtue.

THE YEAR OF SORROW—IRELAND—1849.

AUBREY DE VERE.

XLVIII.—SPRING.


  1. Once more through God’s high will, and grace
      Of hours that each its task fulfills,
    Heart-healing Spring resumes her place,
      The valley throngs and scales the hills

  2. In vain. From earth’s deep heart o’ercharged
      The exulting life runs o’er in flowers;
    The slave unfed is unenlarged:
      In darkness sleep a Nation’s powers.

  3. Who knows not Spring? Who doubts, when blows
      Her breath, that Spring is come indeed?
    The swallow doubts not; nor the rose
      That stirs, but wakes not; nor the weed.

  4. I feel her near, but see her not;
      For these with pain-uplifted eyes
    Fall back repulsed, and vapors blot
      The vision of the earth and skies.

  5. I see her not—I feel her near,
      As, charioted in mildest airs,
    She sails through yon empyreal sphere,
      And in her arms and bosom bears

  6. That urn of flowers and lustral dews,
      Whose sacred balm, o’er all things shed,
    Revives the weak, the old renews,
      And crowns with votive wreaths the dead.

  7. Once more the cuckoo’s call I hear;
      I know, in many a glen profound,
    The earliest violets of the year
      Rise up like water from the ground.

  8. The thorn I know once more is white;
      And, far down many a forest dale,
    The anemones in dubious light
      Are trembling like a bridal veil.

  9. By streams released, that singing flow
      From craggy shelf through sylvan glades;
    The pale narcissus, well I know,
      Smiles hour by hour on greener shades.

  10. The honeyed cowslip tufts once more
      The golden slopes; with gradual ray
    The primrose stars the rock, and o’er
      The wood-path strews its milky way.

  11. From ruined huts and holes come forth
      Old men, and look upon the sky!
    The Power Divine is on the earth:
      Give thanks to God before ye die!

  12. And ye, O children worn and weak!
      Who care no more with flowers to play,
    Lean on the grass your cold, thin cheek,
      And those slight hands, and whispering, say,

  13. “Stern Mother of a race unblest,
      “In promise kindly, cold in deed,—
    “Take back, O Earth, into thy breast,
      “The children whom thou wilt not feed.”




XLIX.—SUMMER.


  1. Approved by works of love and might,
      The Year, consummated and crowned,
    Has scaled the zenith’s purple height,
      And flings his robe the earth around.

  2. Impassioned stillness—fervors calm—
      Brood, vast and bright, o’er land and deep:
    The warrior sleeps beneath the palm;
      The dark-eyed captive guards his sleep.

  3. The Iberian laborer rests from toil;
      Sicilian virgins twine the dance;
    Laugh Tuscan vales in wine and oil;
      Fresh laurels flash from brows of France.

  4. Far off, in regions of the North,
      The hunter drops his winter fur;
    Sun-stricken babes their feet stretch forth;
      And nested dormice feebly stir.

  5. But thou, O land of many woes!
      What cheer is thine? Again the breath
    Of proved Destruction o’er thee blows,
      And sentenced fields grow black in death.

  6. In horror of a new despair
      His blood-shot eyes the peasant strains,
    With hands clenched fast, and lifted hair,
      Along the daily-darkening plains.

  7. “Why trusted he to them his store?
      “Why feared he not the scourge to come?”
    Fool! turn the page of History o’er—
      The roll of Statutes—and be dumb!

  8. Behold, O People! thou shalt die!
      What art thou better than thy sires?
    The hunted deer a weeping eye
      Turns on his birthplace, and expires.

  9. Lo! as the closing of a book,
      Or statue from its base o’erthrown,
    Or blasted wood, or dried-up brook,
      Name, race, and nation, thou art gone.

  10. The stranger shall thy hearth possess;
      The stranger build upon thy grave.
    But know this also—he, not less
      His limit and his term shall have.

  11. Once more thy volume, open cast,
      In thunder forth shall sound thy name;
    Thy forest, hot at heart, at last
      God’s breath shall kindle into flame.

  12. Thy brook dried up, a cloud shall rise,
      And stretch an hourly widening hand,
    In God’s good vengeance, through the skies
      And onward o’er the Invader’s land.

  13. Of thine, one day, a remnant left
      Shall raise o’er earth a Prophet’s rod,
    And teach the coasts of Faith bereft
      The names of Ireland, and of God.




L.—AUTUMN.


  1. Then die, thou Year—thy work is done:
      The work ill done is done at last.
    Far off, beyond that sinking sun
      Which sets in blood, I hear the blast

  2. That sings thy dirge, and says—“Ascend,
      “And answer make amid thy peers,
    “(Since all things here must have an end,)
      “Thou latest of the famine years!”

  3. I join that voice. No joy have I
      In all thy purple and thy gold;
    Nor in that nine fold harmony
      From forest on to forest rolled:

  4. Nor in that stormy western fire,
      Which burns on ocean’s gloomy bed,
    And hurls, as from a funeral pyre,
      A glare that strikes the mountain’s head;

  5. And writes on low-hung clouds its lines
      Of cyphered flame, with hurrying hand;
    And flings amid the topmost pines
      That crown the steep, a burning brand.

  6. Make answer, Year, for all thy dead,
      Who found not rest in hallowed earth;
    The widowed wife, the father fled,
      The babe age-stricken from his birth

  7. Make answer, Year, for virtue lost;
      For courage proof ’gainst fraud and force
    Now waning like a noontide ghost;
      Affections poisoned at their source.

  8. The laborer spurned his lying spade,
      The yeoman spurned his useless plow;
    The pauper spurned the unwholesome aid,
      Obtruded once, exhausted now.

  9. The roof-trees fall of hut and hall,
      I hear them fall, and falling cry,
    “One fate for each, one fate for all;
      So wills the Law that willed a lie.”

  10. Dread power of Man! what spread the waste
      In circles hour by hour more wide,
    And would not let the past be past?—
      The Law that promised much, and lied.

  11. Dread power of God! Whom mortal years
      Nor touch, nor tempt; Who sitt’st sublime
    In night of night—O bid thy spheres
      Resound at last a funeral chime!

  12. Call up at last the afflicted race,
      Whom man, not God, abolished.—Sore,
    For centuries, their strife: the place
      That knew them once shall know no more!




LI.—WINTER.


  1. Fall, snow, and cease not! Flake by flake
      The decent winding-sheet compose.
    Thy task is just and pious; make
      An end of blasphemies and woes.

  2. Fall flake by flake! by thee alone,
      Last friend, the sleeping draught is given:
    Kind nurse, by thee the couch is strewn,
      The couch whose covering is from heaven.

  3. Descend and clasp the mountain’s crest;
      Inherit plain and valley deep:
    This night on thy maternal breast
      A vanquished nation dies in sleep.

  4. Lo! from the starry Temple Gates
      Death rides, and bears the flag of peace:
    The combatants he separates;
      He bids the wrath of ages cease.

  5. Descend, benignant Power! But O,
      Ye torrents, shake no more the vale:
    Dark streams, in silence seaward flow:
      Thou rising storm, remit thy wail.

  6. Shake not, to-night, the cliffs of Moher,
      Nor Brandon’s base, rough sea! Thou Isle,
    The Rite proceeds! From shore to shore,
      Hold in thy gathered breath the while.

  7. Fall, snow! in stillness fall, like dew,
      On church’s roof and cedar’s fan;
    And mold thyself on pine and yew;
      And on the awful face of man.

  8. Without a sound, without a stir,
      In streets and wolds, on rock and mound,
    O, omnipresent Comforter,
      By Thee, this night, the lost are found!

  9. On quaking moor, and mountain moss,
      With eyes upstaring at the sky,
    And arms extended like a cross,
      The long-expectant sufferers lie.

  10. Bend o’er them, white-robed Acolyte!
      Put forth thine hand from cloud and mist;
    And minister the last sad Rite,
      Where altar there is none, nor priest.

  11. Touch thou the gates of soul and sense;
      Touch darkening eyes and dying ears;
    Touch stiffening hands and feet, and thence
      Remove the trace of sin and tears.

  12. And ere thou seal those filmed eyes,
      Into God’s urn thy fingers dip,
    And lay, ’mid eucharistic sighs,
      The sacred wafer on the lip.

  13. This night the Absolver issues forth:
      This night the Eternal Victim bleeds:
    O winds and woods—O heaven and earth!
      Be still this night. The Rite proceeds!




LII.—DEATH OF LITTLE NELL.

DICKENS.


1. By little and little, the old man had drawn back towards the inner
chamber. He pointed there, as he replied, with trembling lips, “You plot
among you to wean my heart from her. You will never do that—never while I
have life. I have no relative or friend but her—I never had—I never will
have. She is all in all to me. It is too late to part us now.”

2. Waving them off with his hand, and calling softly to her as he went,
he stole into the room. They who were left behind drew close together,
and after a few whispered words, not unbroken by emotion, or easily
uttered, followed him. They moved so gently that their footsteps made no
noise; but there were sobs from among the group, and sounds of grief and
mourning. For she was dead.

3. There, upon her little bed, she lay at rest. The solemn stillness was
no marvel now. She was dead. No sleep so beautiful and calm, so free from
trace of pain, so fair to look upon. She seemed a creature fresh from the
hand of God, and waiting for the breath of life; not one who had lived
and suffered death.

4. Her couch was dressed with, here and there, some winter berries and
green leaves, gathered in a spot she had been used to favor. “When I die,
put near me something that has loved the light, and had the sky above it
always.” These were her words.

5. She was dead! Dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell was dead. Her little
bird—a poor slight thing the pressure of a finger would have crushed—was
stirring nimbly in its cage; and the strong heart of its child-mistress
was mute and motionless for ever!

6. Where were the traces of her early cares, her sufferings and fatigues?
All gone. His was the true death before their weeping eyes. Sorrow was
dead indeed in her, but peace and perfect happiness were born; imaged in
her tranquil beauty and profound repose.

7. And still her former self lay there, unaltered in this change. Yes.
The old fireside had smiled on that same sweet face; it had passed like
a dream through haunts of misery and care; at the door of the poor
schoolmaster on the summer evening, before the furnace fire, upon the
cold, wet night, at the still bed-side of the dying boy, there had been
the same mild, lovely look. So shall we know the angels in their majesty,
after death.

8. The old man held one languid arm in his, and kept the small hand
tightly folded to his breast, for warmth. It was the hand she had
stretched out to him with her last smile—the hand that had led him on
through all their wanderings. Ever and anon he pressed it to his lips;
then hugged it to his breast again, murmuring that it was warmer now;
and as he said it, he looked, in agony, to those who stood around, as if
imploring them to help her.

9. She was dead, and past all help, or need of it. The ancient rooms she
had seemed to fill with life, even while her own was ebbing fast—the
garden she had tended—the eyes she had gladdened—the noiseless haunts
of many a thoughtless hour—the paths she had trodden as it were but
yesterday—could know her no more.

10. “It is not,” said the schoolmaster, as he bent down to kiss her on
the cheek, and gave his tears free vent, “it is not in this world that
Heaven’s justice ends. Think what it is compared with the world to which
her young spirit has winged its early flight, and say, if one deliberate
wish, expressed in solemn terms above this bed, could call her back to
life, which of us would utter it!”

11. When morning came, and they could speak more calmly on the subject
of their grief, they heard how her life had closed. They were all about
her at the time, knowing that the end was drawing on. She died soon after
daybreak. They had read and talked to her in the earlier portion of the
night; but as the hours crept on, she sank to sleep. They could tell, by
what she faintly uttered in her dreams, that they were of her journeyings
with the old man; they were of no painful scenes, but of those who had
helped and used them kindly, for she often said “God bless you!” with
great fervor. Waking, she never wandered in her mind but once, and that
was at beautiful music which she said was in the air. It may have been.

12. Opening her eyes at last, from a very quiet sleep she begged that
they would kiss her once again. That done, she turned to the old man with
a lovely smile upon her face—such, they said, as they had never seen, and
never could forget—and clung with both her arms about his neck. They did
not know that she was dead at first. For the rest, she had never murmured
or complained; but with a quiet mind, and manner quite unaltered—save
that she every day became more earnest and more grateful to them—faded
like the light upon the summer’s evening.

13. And now the bell—the bell she had so often heard by night and day,
and listened to with solemn pleasure, almost as a living voice—rung its
remorseless tone for her, so young, so beautiful, so good. Decrepit
age, and vigorous life, and blooming youth, and helpless infancy poured
forth—on crutches, in the pride of strength and health, in the full
blush of promise, in the mere dawn of life; to gather round her with
angels; and when they called to mind how she had looked, and spoken, and
her early death, some thought it might be so indeed. Thus coming to the
grave in little knots, and glancing down, and giving place to others, and
falling off in whispering groups of three or four, the church was cleared
in time of all but the sexton and the mourning friends.

14. They saw the vault covered and the stone fixed down. Then, when
the dusk of evening had come on, and not a sound disturbed the sacred
stillness of the place—when the bright moon poured in her light on tomb
and monument, on pillar, wall, and arch, and most of all (it seems to
them) upon her quiet grave—in that calm time, when all outward things and
inward thoughts teem with assurances of immortality, and worldly hopes
and fears are humbled in the dust before them, then, with tranquil and
submissive hearts, they turned away, and left the child with God.




LIII.—SORROW FOR THE DEAD.

WASHINGTON IRVING.


1. The sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to be
divorced.[387] Every other wound we seek to heal, every other affliction
to forget; but this wound we consider it a duty to keep open; this
affliction we cherish and brood over in solitude. Where is the mother who
would willingly forget the infant that perished like a blossom from her
arms, though every recollection is a pang? Where is the child that would
willingly forget the most tender of parents, though to remember be but to
lament?

2. Who, even in the hour of agony, would forget the friend over whom he
mourns? Who, even when the tomb is closing upon her he most loved—when he
feels his heart, as it were, crushed in the closing of its portals—would
accept of consolation that must be bought by forgetfulness?

3. No, the love which survives the tomb is one of the noblest attributes
of the soul. If it has its woes, it has likewise its delights; and when
the overwhelming burst of grief is calmed into the gentle tear of
recollection, when the sudden anguish and the convulsive agony over the
present ruins of all that we most loved, is softened away into pensive
meditation on all that it was in the days of its loveliness, who could
root out such a sorrow? Though it may sometimes throw a passing cloud
over the bright hour of gayety, or spread a deeper sadness over the hour
of gloom, yet who would exchange it, even for the song of pleasure, or
the burst of revelry?

4. No, there is a voice from the tomb sweeter than song. There is a
remembrance of the dead to which we turn even from the charms of the
living. Oh! the grave! It buries every error, covers every defect,
extinguishes every resentment! From its peaceful bosom spring none but
fond regrets and tender recollections. Who can look down even upon the
grave of an enemy, and not feel a compunctious[388] throb, that he should
ever have warred with the poor handful of earth that lies moldering
before him!

5. But the grave of those we loved, what a place of meditation! There
it is that we call up in long review the whole history of virtue and
gentleness, and the thousand endearments lavished upon us, almost
unheeded in the daily intercourse of intimacy; there it is that we dwell
upon the tenderness, the solemn, awful tenderness of the parting scene;
the bed of death, with all its stifled griefs, its noiseless attendance,
its mute watchful assiduities.

6. The last testimonies of expiring love! the feeble, fluttering,
thrilling, oh! how thrilling! pressure of hand! The faint, faltering
accents, struggling in death to give one more assurance of affection!
The last fond look of the glazing eye, turning upon us even from the
threshold of existence! Ay, go to the grave of buried love, and
meditate. There settle the account with thy conscience for every past
benefit unrequited[389], every past endearment unregarded, of that
departed being, who can never, never, never return to be soothed by thy
contrition.

7. If thou art a child, and hast ever added a sorrow to the soul, or a
furrow to the silvered brow of an affectionate parent; if thou art a
husband, and hast ever caused the fond bosom that ventured its whole
happiness in thy arms, to doubt one moment of thy kindness or thy truth;
if thou art a friend, and hast ever wronged in thought, or word, or deed,
the spirit that generously confided in thee; if thou art a lover, and
hast ever given one unmerited pang to that true heart which now lies cold
and still beneath thy feet;—then be sure that every unkind look, every
ungracious word, every ungentle action, will come thronging back to thy
memory, and knock dolefully at thy soul; then be sure that thou wilt lie
down sorrowing and repentant in the grave, and utter the unheard groan,
and pour the unavailing tear, more deep, more bitter, because unheard and
unavailing.

8. Then weave thy chaplet of flowers, and strew the beauties of Nature
about the grave, console thy broken spirit, if thou canst, with these
tender, yet futile[390] tributes of regret; but take warning by the
bitterness of this thy contrite[391] affliction over the dead, and
henceforth be more faithful and affectionate in the discharge of thy
duties to the living.

[387] DI-VORCEDˊ, disunited or separated.

[388] COM-PUNC-TIOUS, repentant; sorrowful.

[389] UNˊ-RE-QUITED, not repaid; not done or given in return.

[390] FUˊ-TILE, trifling; worthless.

[391] CONˊ-TRITE, sorrowful; bowed down with grief.




LIV.—ISABELLA THE CATHOLIC, QUEEN OF SPAIN.

PRESCOTT.

  William H. Prescott was born in Salem, Mass., May 4th, 1796, and
  died in Boston, January 28 1859. His historical and biographical
  works, published in fifteen octavo volumes, have enjoyed a wide
  and deserved popularity; although in many instances marred by
  views and statements, which seem to betray a mind warped by
  religious prejudice. In his edition of Robertson’s “History of
  the Emperor Charles V.” he has permitted some of the most glaring
  errors of that writer to pass uncorrected, although Maitland, in
  his admirable work entitled “The Dark Ages,” had very clearly and
  conclusively exposed them.


1. Her person was of the middle height, and well proportioned. She had a
clear, fresh complexion, with light blue eyes and auburn hair, a style
of beauty exceedingly rare in Spain. Her features were regular, and
universally allowed to be uncommonly handsome.

2. The illusion which attaches to rank, more especially when united with
engaging manners, might lead us to suspect some exaggeration in the
encomiums[392] so liberally lavished on her. But they would seem to be
in a great measure justified by the portraits that remain of her, which
combine a faultless symmetry[393] of features, with singular sweetness
and intelligence of expression.

3. Her manners were most gracious and pleasing. They were marked by
natural dignity and modest reserve, tempered by an affability[394] which
flowed from the kindliness of her disposition. She was the last person to
be approached with undue familiarity; yet the respect which she imposed
was mingled with the strongest feelings of devotion and love.

4. She showed great tact in accommodating herself to the peculiar
situation and character of those around her. She appeared in arms at
the head of her troops, and shrunk from none of the hardships of war.
During the reforms introduced into the religious houses, she visited the
nunneries[395] in person, taking her needle-work with her, and passing
the day in the society of the inmates. When traveling in Galicia,[396]
she attired herself in the costume of the country, borrowing for
that purpose the jewels and other ornaments of the ladies there, and
returning them with liberal additions. By this condescending and
captivating deportment, as well as by her higher qualities, she gained an
ascendency[397] over her turbulent[398] subjects, which no king of Spain
could ever boast.

5. She spoke the Castilian[399] with much elegance and correctness.
She had an easy fluency of discourse, which, though generally of a
serious complexion, was occasionally seasoned with agreeable sallies,
some of which have passed into proverbs. She was temperate, even to
abstemiousness,[400] in her diet, seldom or never tasting wine: and so
frugal in her table, that the daily expenses of herself and family did
not exceed the moderate sum of forty ducats.[401]

6. She was equally simple and economical in her apparel. On all public
occasions, indeed, she displayed a royal magnificence;[402] but she had
no relish for it in private, and she freely gave away her clothes and
jewels, as presents to her friends.

7. Naturally of a sedate, though cheerful temper, she had little taste
for the frivolous amusements which make up so much of a court life; and,
if she encouraged the presence of minstrels and musicians in her palace,
it was to wean her young nobility from the coarser and less intellectual
pleasures to which they were addicted.

8. Among her moral qualities, the most conspicuous, perhaps, was her
magnanimity.[403] She betrayed nothing little or selfish, in thought or
action. Her schemes were vast, and executed in the same noble spirit
in which they were conceived. She never employed doubtful agents, or
sinister measures, but the most direct and open policy. She scorned to
avail herself of advantages offered by the perfidy[404] of others.

9. Where she had once given her confidence, she gave her hearty and
steady support: and she was scrupulous to redeem any pledge she had made
to those who ventured in her cause, however unpopular. She sustained
Ximenes[405] in all his obnoxious[406] but salutary reforms. She seconded
Columbus in the prosecution of his arduous enterprise, and shielded him
from the calumny[407] of his enemies. She did the same good service to
her favorite, Gonsalvo de Cordova;[408] and the day of her death was
felt, and, as it proved, truly felt, by both, as the last of their good
fortune.

10. Artifice[409] and duplicity[410] were so abhorrent to her character,
and so averse from her domestic policy, that when they appear in the
foreign relations of Spain, it is certainly not imputable to her. She
was incapable of harboring any petty distrust, or latent malice; and,
although stern in the execution and exaction of public justice, she made
the most generous allowance, and even, sometimes, advances, to those who
had personally injured her.

11. But the principle which gave a peculiar coloring to every feature of
Isabella’s mind, was piety. It shone forth from the very depths of her
soul with a heavenly radiance, which illuminated her whole character.
Fortunately, her earliest years had been passed in the rugged school of
adversity, under the eye of a mother who implanted in her serious mind
such strong principles of religion, as nothing in after life had power to
shake.

12. At an early age, in the flower of youth and beauty, she was
introduced to her brother’s court; but its blandishments,[411] so
dazzling to a young imagination, had no power over hers; for she was
surrounded by a moral atmosphere of purity, “driving far off each thing
of sin and guilt.” Such was the decorum of her manners, that, though
encompassed by false friends and open enemies, not the slightest reproach
was breathed on her fair name in this corrupt and calumnious[412] court.

LV.—PALESTINE.

ALTERED FROM WHITTIER.

  John Greenleaf Whittier is a well-known and popular writer in
  prose and verse.


  1. Blest land of Judea! thrice hallowed of song,
    Where the holiest of memories, pilgrim-like, throng
    In the shade of thy palms, by the shores of thy sea,
    On the hills of thy beauty—my heart is with thee.
    With the eye of a spirit I look on that shore,
    Where pilgrim and prophet have lingered before;
    With the guide of a spirit I traverse the sod
    Made bright by the steps of the angels of God.

  2. Blue sea of the hills! in my spirit I hear
    Thy waters, Gennesaret[413], chime on my ear;
    Where the Lowly and Just with the people sat down,
    And thy spray on the dust of His sandals was thrown.
    Beyond are Bethulia’s[414] mountains of green,
    And the desolate hills of the wild Gadarene[415];
    And I pause on the goat-crags of Tabor[416] to see
    The gleam of thy waters, O dark Galilee!

  3. There sleep the still rocks and the caverns which rang
    To the song which the beautiful prophetess sang,
    When the princes of Issachar[417] stood by her side,
    And the shout of a host in its triumph replied.
    Lo! Bethlehem’s[418] hill-site before me is seen,
    With the mountains around and the valleys between;
    There rested the shepherds of Judah[419], and there,
    The song of the angels rose sweet on the air.

  4. And Bethany’s[420] palm trees in beauty still throw
    Their shadows at noon on the ruins below;
    But where are the sisters who hastened to greet
    The lowly Redeemer, and sit at his feet?
    I tread where the Twelve in their wayfaring trod;
    I stand where they stood with the Incarnate God;
    Where his blessing was heard, and his lessons were taught;
    Where the blind were restored, and the healing was wrought.

[413] GEN-NESˊ-A-RET, a sea or lake in Palestine, the borders of which,
in the time of Christ, were covered with numerous towns and villages;

LVI.—LOVE OF COUNTRY AND OF HOME.

MONTGOMERY.


  1. There is a land, of every land the pride,
    Beloved by heaven o’er all the world beside;
    Where brighter suns dispense[421] serener[422] light,
    And milder moons imparadise[423] the night:
    A land of beauty, virtue, valor, truth,
    Time-tutored age, and love-exalted youth.

  2. The wandering mariner, whose eye explores
    The wealthiest isles, the most enchanting shores,
    Views not a realm so bountiful and fair,
    Nor breathes the spirit of a purer air;
    In every clime, the magnet[424] of his soul,
    Touched by remembrance, trembles to that pole:

  3. For in this land of heaven’s peculiar grace,
    The heritage[425] of nature’s noblest race,
    There is a spot of earth supremely[426] blest,
    A dearer, sweeter pot than all the rest,
    Where man, creation’s tyrant, casts aside
    His sword and scepter, pageantry and pride,
    While, in his softened looks, benignly[427] blend
    The sire, the son, the husband, father, friend.

  4. Here woman reigns; the mother, daughter, wife,
    Strews with fresh flowers the narrow way of life;
    In the clear heaven of her delightful eye,
    An angel guard of loves and graces lie;
    Around her knees domestic duties meet,
    And fireside pleasures gambol[428] at her feet.
    Where shall that land, that spot of earth be found?
    Art thou a man? a patriot?[429] look around;
    Oh! thou shalt find, howe’er thy footsteps roam,
    That land _thy_ country, and that spot _thy_ home.

LVII.—THE HEAVENLY REST.

ANON.


  1. There is an hour of peaceful rest
        To mourning wanderers given,
      There is a tear for souls distrest,
      A balm for every wounded breast—
        ’Tis found above—in heaven!

  2. There is a soft, a downy bed,
        ’Tis sweet as breath of even;
    A couch for weary mortals spread,
    Where they may rest the aching head,
        And find repose in heaven!

  3. There is a home for weary souls,
        By sin and sorrow driven,
    When tossed on life’s tempestuous shoals
    Where storms arise, and ocean rolls,
        And all is drear—but heaven!

  4. There faith lifts up the tearful eye,
        The heart with anguish riven;
    And views the tempest passing by,
    The evening shadows quickly fly,
        And all serene in heaven!

  5. The fragrant flowers immortal bloom.
        And joys supreme are given;
    There rays divine disperse the gloom:
    Beyond the confines of the tomb
        Appears the dawn of heaven!




LVIII.—LOVE OF COUNTRY.

SCOTT.


  1. Breathes there the man, with soul so dead
    Who never to himself hath said,
      “This is my own, my native land!”
    Whose heart has ne’er within him burned,
    As home his footsteps he hath turned,
      From wandering on a foreign strand?
    If such there breathe, go, mark him well;
    For him no minstrel raptures swell.

  2. High though his titles, proud his name,
    Boundless his wealth as wish can claim;
    Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
    The wretch, concentrated all in self,
    Living, shall forfeit fair renown;
    And, doubly dying, shall go down
    To the vile dust from which he sprung,
    Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.

  3. O Caledonia! stern and wild,
    Meet nurse for a poetic child,
    Land of brown heath and shaggy wood,
    Land of the mountain and the flood.
    Land of my sires; what mortal hand
    Can e’er untie the filial band
    That knits me to thy rugged strand!




LIX.—THE CHARMED SERPENT.

CHATEAUBRIAND.


1. One day, while we were encamped in a spacious[430] plain on the bank
of the Genesee river, we saw a rattlesnake. There was a Canadian in our
party who could play on the flute, and to divert us he advanced toward
the serpent with his new species of weapon. On the approach of his enemy,
the haughty[431] reptile curls himself into a spiral[432] line, flattens
his head, inflates[433] his cheeks, contracts his lips, displays his
envenomed fangs and his bloody throat. His double tongue glows like
two flames of fire; his eyes are burning coals; his body, swollen with
rage, rises and falls like the bellows of a forge; his dilated[434] skin
assumes a dull and scaly appearance; and his tail, which sends forth an
ominous sound, vibrates[435] with such rapidity as to resemble a light
vapor.

2. The Canadian now begins to play on his flute. The serpent starts with
surprise and draws back his head. In proportion as he is struck with the
magic sound, his eyes lose their fierceness, the oscillations[436] of his
tail diminish, and the noise which it emits grows weaker, and gradually
dies away. The spiral folds of the charmed serpent, diverging from the
perpendicular,[437] expand,[438] and one after the other sink to the
ground in concentric[439] circles. The tints of azure, green, white,
and gold, recover their brilliancy on his quivering skin, and, slightly
turning his head, he remains motionless in the attitude of attention and
pleasure.

3. At this moment the Canadian advances a few steps, producing with
his flute sweet and simple notes. The reptile immediately lowers his
variegated[440] neck, opens a passage with his head through the slender
grass, and begins to creep after the musician, halting when he halts, and
again following him when he resumes his march. In this way he was led
beyond the limits of our camp, attended by a great number of spectators,
both savages and Europeans, who could scarcely believe their eyes. After
witnessing this wonderful effect of melody, the assembly unanimously
decided that the marvelous[441] serpent should be permitted to escape.

LX.—MY ROSARY.

SIR HUMPHREY DAVY.

  Sir Humphrey Davy was born in England, December 17, 1779,
  and died at Geneva, May 29, 1829. He made several valuable
  discoveries in chemistry.


1. The rosary which you see suspended around my neck, is a memorial[442]
of sympathy and respect for an illustrious man. I was passing through
France, in the reign of Napoleon, by the peculiar privilege granted to
a _savant_,[443] on my road to Italy. I had just returned from the Holy
Land, and had in my possession two or three of the rosaries which are
sold to pilgrims at Jerusalem, as having been suspended in the Holy
Sepulchre. Pius VII. was then in imprisonment at Fontainebleau. By a
special favor, on the plea of my return from the Holy Land, I obtained
permission to see this venerable and illustrious pontiff. I carried with
me one of my rosaries.

2. He received me with great kindness. I tendered my services to execute
any commissions, not political ones, he might think fit to intrust me
with, in Italy, informing him that I was an Englishman: he expressed his
thanks, but declined troubling me. I told him that I was just returned
from the Holy Land; and, bowing, with great humility, offered him my
rosary from the Holy Sepulchre.

3. He received it with a smile, touched it with his lips, gave his
benediction over it, and returned it into my hands, supposing, of course,
that I was a Roman Catholic. I had meant to present it to his Holiness;
but the blessing he had bestowed upon it, and the touch of his lips, made
it a precious relic to me; and I restored it to my neck, round which it
has ever since been suspended.... “We shall meet again; adieu:” and he
gave me his paternal blessing.

4. It was eighteen months after this interview, that I went out, with
almost the whole population of Rome, to receive and welcome the triumphal
entry of this illustrious father of the church into his capital. He
was borne on the shoulders of the most distinguished artists, headed
by Canova;[444] and never shall I forget the enthusiasm with which
he was received: it is impossible to describe the shouts of triumph
and of rapture sent up to heaven by every voice. And when he gave his
benediction to the people, there was a universal prostration,[445] a
sobbing, and marks of emotion and joy, almost like the bursting of the
heart. I heard everywhere around me cries of a “The holy father! the most
holy father! His restoration is the work of God!”

5. I saw tears streaming from the eyes of almost all the women about me,
many of whom were sobbing hysterically,[446] and old men were weeping as
if they were children. I pressed my rosary to my breast on this occasion,
and repeatedly touched with my lips that part of it which had received
the kiss of the most venerable pontiff. I preserve it with a kind of
hallowed feeling, as the memorial of a man whose sanctity, firmness,
meekness, and benevolence, are an honor to his Church and to human
nature: and it has not only been useful to me, by its influence upon my
own mind, but it has enabled me to give pleasure to others; and has, I
believe, been sometimes beneficial in insuring my personal safety.

6. I have often gratified the peasants of Apulia and Calabria, by
presenting them to kiss a rosary from the Holy Sepulchre, which had been
hallowed by the touch of the lips and benediction of the Pope: and it has
even been respected by, and procured me a safe passage through, a party
of brigands, who once stopped me in the passes of the Apennines.

[442] ME-MOˊ-RIAL, that which preserves the memory of something.

[443] SA-VANTˊ, (sä-väng), a man of learning.

[444] CA-NOˊ-VA, a celebrated Italian sculptor, born November 1, 1757,
died October 13, 1822.

[445] PROS-TRAˊ-TION, a bowing down.

[446] HYS-TERˊ-I-CAL-LY, in an extremely nervous or convulsive manner.




LXI.—THE INDIANS.

STORY.

  Joseph Story died in 1845. He was one of the Associate Justices
  of the Supreme Court of the United States. He is best known by
  his “Commentaries on the Constitution,” which he prepared in
  pursuance of his duties as Dane Professor of Law, in Harvard
  University.


1. There is, in the fate of these unfortunate beings, much to awaken
our sympathy, and much to disturb the sobriety of our judgment: much
which may be urged to excuse their own atrocities;[447] much in their
characters which betray us into an involuntary[448] admiration. What
can be more eloquent than their history? By a law of nature they seemed
destined[449] to a slow but sure extinction.[450] Everywhere at the
approach of the white man they fade away. We hear the rustling of their
footsteps, like that of the withered leaves of autumn, and they are gone
forever.

2. They pass mournfully by us, and they return no more. Two centuries
ago, and the smoke of their wigwams,[451] and the fires of their councils
rose in every valley, from the Hudson Bay to the farthest Florida, from
the ocean to the Mississippi and the lakes. The shouts of victory and the
war-dance rang through the mountains and glades. The thick arrows and the
deadly tomahawk whistled through the forests; and the hunter’s trace and
dark encampment startled the wild beasts in their lairs. The warriors
stood forth in their glory. The young listened to the song of other days.
The mothers played with their infants, and gazed on the scene with warm
hopes of the future. The aged sat down, but they wept not: they should
soon be at rest in finer regions, where the Great Spirit dwells, in a
home prepared for the brave beyond the western skies.

3. Braver men never lived; truer men never drew the bow. They had
courage, and fortitude, and sagacity, and perseverance beyond most of the
human race. They shrank from no dangers, and they feared no hardships. If
they had the vices of savage life, they had its virtues also. They were
true to their country, their friends, and their homes. If they forgave
not injury, neither did they forget kindness. If their vengeance was
terrible, their fidelity and generosity were unconquerable also. Their
love, like their hatred, stopped not this side of the grave.

4. But where are they? Where are the villagers and warriors and youth;
the sachems and the tribes; the hunters and their families? They have
perished; they are consumed. The wasting pestilence[452] has not alone
done the mighty work. No, nor famine—nor war; there has been a mightier
power; a moral canker, which has eaten into their heart cores—a plague,
which the touch of the white man communicated—a poison which betrayed
them to lingering ruin. The winds of the Atlantic fan not a single region
which they may call their own. Already the last feeble remnant of their
race are preparing for their journey beyond the Mississippi. I see them
leave their miserable homes—the aged, the helpless, the men, and the
warriors—“few and faint, yet fearless still.”

5. The ashes are cold upon their native hearths. The smoke no longer
curls around their lowly cabins. They move on with slow, unsteady steps.
The white man is upon their heels for terror or dispatch, but they heed
him not. They turn to take a last look of their desolate villages. They
cast a last glance upon the graves of their fathers. They shed no tears;
they utter no cry; they heave no groans. There is something in their
hearts which passes speech. There is something in their looks, not of
vengeance or submission, but of hard necessity, which stifles both; which
chokes all utterance; which has no aim or method. It is courage, absorbed
by despair. They linger but a moment. Their look is onward.

6. They have passed the fatal stream. It shall never be repassed by them,
no—never. Yet there lies not between us and them an impassable gulf.
They know and feel that there is for them still one remove farther, not
distant nor unseen. It is to the general burial-ground of their race.

7. Reason as we may, it is impossible not to read in such a fate much
which we know not how to interpret; much of provocation to cruel deeds
and deep resentments; much of apology for wrong and perfidy; much of
pity, mingling with indignation; much of doubt and misgiving as to the
past; much of painful recollections, much of dark forebodings.

LXII.—INDIAN NAMES.

SIGOURNEY.


  1. Ye say, they all have passed away,
      That noble race and brave,
    That their light canoes have vanished
      From off the crested wave;
    That ’mid the forests where they roamed
      There rings no hunter’s shout;
    But their name is on your waters,
      You may not wash it out.

  2. ’Tis where Ontario’s billow
      Like Ocean’s surge is curled,
    Where strong Niagara’s thunders wake
      The echo of the world;
    Where red Missouri bringeth
      Rich tributes from the West,
    And Rappahannock sweetly sleeps
      On green Virginia’s breast.

  3. Ye say, their cone-like cabins,
      That clustered o’er the vale,
    Have fled away like withered leaves
      Before the autumn gale;
    But their memory liveth on your hills,
      Their baptism on your shore,
    Your everlasting rivers speak
      Their dialect of yore.

  4. Old Massachusetts wears it
      Within her lordly crown,
    And broad Ohio bears it,
      Amid her young renown;
    Connecticut hath wreathed it
      Where her quiet foliage waves,
    And bold Kentucky breathes it hoarse,
      Through all her ancient caves.

  5. Wachusett hides its lingering voice
      Within his rocky heart,
    And Alleghany graves its tone
      Throughout his lofty chart:
    Monadnock on his forehead hoar
      Doth seal the sacred trust;
    Your mountains build their monuments,
      Though ye destroy their dust.




LXIII.—THE FRIARS AND THE KNIGHT.

DIGBY.

  Kenelm H. Digby is the author of several very valuable and
  interesting works. His “Mores Catholici,” “Broad Stone of Honor,”
  “Compitum,” and “Lover’s Seat,” prove him to be a writer of high
  culture and great research.


1. Two friars of Paris, traveling in the depth of winter, came, at
the first hour of the night, fatigued, covered with mud, and wet with
rain, to the gate of a house where they hoped to receive hospitality,
not knowing that it belonged to a knight who hated all friars, and
who for twenty years had never made his confession. The mother of the
family replied to their petition, “I know not, good fathers, what to
do. If I admit you under our roof, I fear my husband; and if I send
you away cruelly in this tempestuous[453] night, I shall dread the
indignation[454] of God. Enter, and hide yourselves till my husband
returns from hunting, and has supped, for then I shall be able to supply
you secretly with what is needful.”

2. Shortly, the husband returns, sups joyfully, but, perceiving that his
wife is sad, desires to know the cause. She replies that she dares not
disclose[455] it. Pressed and encouraged, she at length relates what has
happened, adding, that she fears God’s judgment, seeing that His servants
are afflicted with cold and hunger, while they are feasting at their
ease. The knight, becoming more gentle, orders them to be led forth from
their hiding-place, and to be supplied with food.

3. The poor friars came forth, and drew near the fire; and when he sees
their emaciated[456] faces, humid[457] raiment,[458] and their feet
stained with blood, the hand of the Lord is upon him, and from a lion
he becomes a lamb. With his own hands he washes their feet, places the
table, and prepares their beds, bringing in fresh straw. After the
supper, with altered look and tone, he addresses the elder friar, and
asks whether a shameless sinner, who hath not confessed since many years,
can hope for pardon from God?

4. “Yea, in sooth,” replied the friar; “hope in the Lord, and do good,
and he will deal with thee according to his mercy; for in whatever day
the sinner repents, he will remember his iniquity no more.” The contrite
host declares that he will not then defer any longer approaching the
sacraments. “This very night,” said he, “I will unburden my conscience,
lest my soul should be required of me.” The friar, however, little
suspecting danger of death, advised him to wait till morning. All retired
to rest; but during the night the friar became alarmed, rose, prostrated
himself on the earth, and besought God to spare the sinner.

5. In the morning, however, the master of the house was found dead. The
man of God, judging from what had passed, consoled the widow, declared
that in his dreams he had been assured of the salvation of her husband;
and the man was buried honorably, bells tolled, and Mass was sung, and
the friars departed on their way.

6. It is to instances of this kind that St. Jerome alludes in his
beautiful epistle to Lacta, where he says, “A holy and faithful family
must needs sanctify its infidel chief. That man cannot be far from
entering upon the career of faith, who is surrounded by sons and
grandsons enlightened by the faith.”

LXIV.—WHERE THERE’S A WILL THERE’S A WAY.

ELIZA COOK.


  1. We have faith in old proverbs[459] full surely,
      For wisdom has traced[460] what they tell,
    And truth may be drawn up as purely
      From them, as it may from a “well.”
    Let us question the thinkers and doers,
      And hear what they honestly say,
    And you’ll find they believe, like bold wooers,[461]
      In “_Where there’s a WILL there’s a WAY_.”

  2. The hills have been high for man’s mounting,
      The woods have been dense[462] for his ax,
    The stars have been thick for his counting,
      The sands have been wide for his tracks.
    The sea has been deep for his diving,
      The poles have been broad for his sway,
    But bravely he’s proved by his striving,[463]
      That “_Where there’s a WILL there’s a WAY_.”

  3. Have ye vices that ask a destroyer,
      Or passions that need your control?[464]
    Let Reason become your employer,
      And your body be ruled by your soul.
    Fight on, though ye bleed at the trial,
      Resist with all strength that ye may,
    Ye may conquer Sin’s host by denial,
      For, “_Where there’s a WILL there’s a WAY_.”

  4. Have ye poverty’s pinching to cope[465] with?
      Does suffering weigh down your might?
    Only call up a spirit to hope with,
      And dawn may come out of the night.
    Oh! much may be done by defying[466]
      The ghost[467] of Despair and Dismay,
    And much may be gained by relying[468]
      On “_Where there’s a WILL there’s a WAY_.”

  5. Should you see afar off that worth winning,[469]
      Set out on a journey with trust,
    And ne’er heed though your path at beginning
      Should be among brambles[470] and dust.
    Though it is by footsteps ye do it,
      And hardships may hinder and stay,
    Keep a heart and be sure ye go through it,
      For, “_Where there’s a WILL there’s a WAY_.”

LXV.—NOW, TO-DAY.

ADELAIDE A. PROCTOR.


  1. Arise! for the day is passing,
      And you lie dreaming on;
    Your brothers are cased in armor,[471]
      And forth to the fight are gone!
    A place in the ranks awaits you;
      Each man has some part to play;
    The Past and the Future are nothing
      In the face of stern TO-DAY.

  2. Arise from your dreams of the Future—
      Of gaining some hard-fought field,
    Of storming[472] some airy[473] fortress,[474]
      Or bidding some giant yield;
    Your future has deeds of glory,
      Of honor, (God grant it may!)
    But your arm will never be stronger,
      Or needed as _now_—TO-DAY.

  3. Arise! if the Past detain[475] you,
      Her sunshines and storms forget;
    No chains so unworthy to hold you
      As those of a vain regret;
    Sad or bright, she is lifeless ever;
      Cast her phantom[476] arms away,
    Nor look back, save to learn the lesson
      Of a nobler strife TO-DAY.

  4. ARISE! for the day is passing!
      The sound that you scarcely hear,
    Is the enemy marching to battle!
      _Rise!_ RISE! for the foe is near!
    Stay not to sharpen your weapons,
      Or the hour will strike at last,
    When, from dreams of a coming battle,
      You may wake to find it past!

[471] ARMˊ-OR, defensive arms.

[472] STORMˊ-ING, taking by assault.

[473] AIRˊ-Y, fanciful; visionary.

[474] FORˊ-TRESS, fort; strong hold.

[475] DE-TAINˊ, hinder; keep back.

[476] PHANˊ-TOM, specter; ghost-like.




LXVI.—PATRIOTISM AND CHRISTIANITY.

CHATEAUBRIAND.


1. But it is the Christian religion that has invested[477]
patriotism[478] with its true character. This sentiment led to the
commission of crime among the ancients, because it was carried to
excess; Christianity has made it one of the principal affections in
man, but not an exclusive[479] one. It commands us above all things to
be just; it requires us to cherish the whole family of Adam, since we
ourselves belong to it, though our countrymen have the first claim to our
attachment.

2. This morality was unknown before the coming of the Christian
law-giver, who had been unjustly accused of attempting to extirpate[480]
the passions: God destroys not his own work. The Gospel is not the
destroyer of the heart, but its regulator. It is to our feelings what
taste is to the fine arts; it retrenches all that is exaggerated, false,
common, and trivial.[481] It leaves all that is fair, and good, and true.
The Christian religion, rightly understood, is only primitive[482] nature
washed from original[483] pollution.[484]

3. It is when at a distance from our country that we feel the full force
of the instinct by which we are attached to it. For want of the reality,
we try to feed upon dreams; for the heart is expert in deception, and
there is no one who has been suckled at the breast of a woman but has
drunk of the cup of illusion.[485] Sometimes it is a cottage which is
situated like the paternal habitation; sometimes it is a wood, a valley,
a hill, on which we bestow some of the sweet appellations[486] of our
native land. Andromache gives the name of Simois to a brook. And what an
affecting object is this little rill, which recalls the idea of a mighty
river to her native country! Remote from the soil which gave us birth,
nature appears to us diminished, and but the shadow of that which we have
lost.

4. Another artifice of the love of country is to attach a great value
to an object of little intrinsic worth, but which comes from our native
land, and which we have brought with us into exile. The soul seems to
dwell even upon the inanimate things which have shared our destiny: we
remain attached to the down on which our prosperity has slumbered, and
still more to the straw on which we counted the days of our adversity.
The vulgar have an energetic expression, to describe the languor which
oppresses the soul when away from our country. “That man,” they say, “is
home-sick.”

5. A sickness it really is, and the only cure for it is to return. If,
however, we have been absent for a few years, what do we find in the
place of our nativity? How few of those whom we left behind in the vigor
of health are still alive! Here are tombs where once stood palaces; there
rise palaces where once stood tombs. The paternal field is overgrown with
briers, or cultivated by the plow of a stranger; and the tree beneath
which we frolicked in our boyish days has disappeared.

6. Were we asked, what are those powerful ties which bind us to the place
of nativity, we should find some difficulty in answering the question.
It is, perhaps, the smile of a mother, of a father, of a sister; it
is, perhaps, the recollection of an old preceptor[487] who instructed
us, and of the young companions of our childhood; it is, perhaps, the
care bestowed upon us by a tender nurse or by some aged domestic, so
essential a part of the household; finally, it is something most simple,
and, if you please, trivial,—a dog that barked at night in the fields,
a nightingale that returned every year to the orchard, the nest of the
swallow over the window, the village clock that appeared above the
trees, the churchyard yew, or the Gothic tomb. Yet these simple things
demonstrate the more clearly the reality of a Providence, as they could
not possibly be the source of patriotism, or of the great virtues which
it begets, unless by the appointment of the Almighty himself.

LXVII.—BEST KIND OF REVENGE.

CHAMBERS.


1. Some years ago, a warehouseman in Manchester, England, published a
scurrilous[488] pamphlet, in which he endeavored to hold up the house of
Grant Brothers to ridicule. William Grant remarked upon the occurrence
that the man would live to repent what he had done; and this was conveyed
by some tale-bearer to the libeller, who said, “Oh, I suppose he thinks
I shall some time or other be in his debt; but I will take good care of
that.” It happens, however, that a man in business cannot always choose
who shall be his creditors. The pamphleteer became a bankrupt, and the
brothers held an acceptance[489] of his which had been indorsed[490] to
them by the drawer, who had also become a bankrupt[491].

2. The wantonly libelled men had thus become creditors of the libeller!
They had it in their power to make him repent of his audacity.[492] He
could not obtain his certificate without their signature, and without it
he could not enter into business again. He had obtained the number of
signatures required by the bankrupt law, except one. It seemed folly to
hope that the firm of “the brothers” would supply the deficiency.[493]
What! they, who had cruelly been made the laughing stock of the public,
forget the wrong and favor the wrong doer? He despaired. But the claims
of a wife and children forced him at last to make the application.
Humbled by misery, he presented himself at the counting house of the
wronged.

3. Mr. William Grant was there alone, and his first words to the
delinquent[494] were, “Shut the door, sir!” sternly uttered. The door
was shut, and the libeller stood trembling before the libelled. He told
his tale, and produced his certificate, which was instantly clutched by
the injured merchant. “You wrote a pamphlet against us once!” exclaimed
Mr. Grant. The supplicant expected to see his parchment thrown into the
fire. But this was not its destination. Mr. Grant took a pen, and writing
something upon the document, handed it back to the bankrupt. He, poor
wretch, expected to see “rogue, scoundrel, libeller,” inscribed, but
there was, in fair round characters, the signature of the firm.

4. “We make it a rule,” said Mr. Grant, “never to refuse signing the
certificate of an honest tradesman, and we have never heard that you were
anything else.” The tears started into the poor man’s eyes. “Ah,” said
Mr. Grant, “my saying was true. I said you would live to repent writing
that pamphlet. I did not mean it as a threat. I only meant that some day
you would know us better, and be sorry you had tried to injure us. I see
you repent of it now.” “I do, I do!” said the grateful man. “I bitterly
repent it.” “Well, well, my dear fellow, you know us now. How do you get
on? What are you going to do?” The poor man stated that he had friends
who could assist him when his certificate was obtained. “But how are you
off in the meantime?”

5. And the answer was, that, having given up every farthing to his
creditors, he had been compelled to stint his family of even common
necessaries, that he might be enabled to pay the cost of his certificate.
“My dear fellow, this will not do; your family must not suffer. Be kind
enough to take this ten-pound note to your wife from me. There, there,
my dear fellow! Nay, don’t cry; it will be all well with you yet. Keep up
your spirits, set to work like a man, and you will raise your head among
us yet.” The overpowered man endeavored in vain to express his thanks:
the swelling in his throat forbade words. He put his handkerchief to his
face, and went out of the door crying like a child.

LXVIII—QUEEN ELIZABETH OF HUNGARY.

MONTALEMBERT.


1. Generosity to the poor, particularly that exercised by princes, was
one of the most remarkable features of the age in which she lived; but
we perceive that, in her, charity did not proceed from rank, still less
from the desire of acquiring praises or purely human gratitude, but from
an interior and heavenly inspiration. From her cradle, she could not
bear the sight of a poor person without feeling her heart pierced with
grief, and now that her husband had granted her full liberty in all that
concerned the honor of God and the good of her neighbor, she unreservedly
abandoned herself to her natural inclination to solace[495] the suffering
members of Christ.

2. This was her ruling thought each hour and moment: to the use
of the poor she dedicated[496] all that she retrenched from the
superfluities[497] usually required by her sex and rank. Yet,
notwithstanding the resources which the charity of her husband placed
at her disposal, she gave away so quickly all that she possessed, that
it often happened that she would despoil[498] herself of her clothes in
order to have the means of assisting the unfortunate.

3. Elizabeth loved to carry secretly to the poor, not alone money, but
provisions and other matters which she destined for them. She went thus
laden, by the winding and rugged paths that led from the castle to the
city, and to cabins of the neighboring valleys.

4. One day, when accompanied by one of her favorite maidens, as she
descended by a rude little path (still pointed out) and carried under
her mantle, bread, meat, eggs, and other food to distribute to the poor,
she suddenly encountered her husband, who was returning from hunting.
Astonished to see her thus toiling on under the weight of her burden, he
said to her, “Let us see what you carry,” and at the same time drew open
the mantle which she held closely clasped to her bosom; but beneath it
were only red and white roses, the most beautiful he had ever seen—and
this astonished him, as it was no longer the season of flowers.

5. Seeing that Elizabeth was troubled, he sought to console her by his
caresses; but he ceased suddenly, on seeing over her head a luminous[499]
appearance in the form of a crucifix. He then desired her to continue
her route without being disturbed by him, and he returned to Wartbourg,
meditating with recollection on what God did for her, and carrying with
him one of these wonderful roses, which he preserved all his life.

6. At the spot where this meeting took place, he erected a pillar,
surmounted by a cross, to consecrate forever the remembrance of that
which he had seen hovering over the head of his wife. Among the
unfortunate who particularly attracted her compassion, those who occupied
the greatest part in her heart were the lepers;[500] the mysterious and
special character of their malady rendered them, throughout the middle
ages, objects of a solicitude and affection mingled with fear.

LXIX.—WILLIAM TELL.

KNOWLES.

  Switzerland was at one time subject to Austria. Gesler
  (pronounced Gesˊler), at the time of these events, in 1307,
  was the Austrian governor of Switzerland. He was a most cruel
  tyrant, and even pushed his tyranny so far as to require the
  Swiss to uncover their heads and bow down to his hat placed upon
  a pole. William Tell, a brave Swiss, refused to perform this act
  of servility. He was seized for punishment. Tell’s son, Albert,
  without his father’s knowledge, had been taken prisoner on the
  preceding day by Gesler. The truth of the narrative of the
  exploits of William Tell has been recently called in question.


  SCENE—A Chamber in the Castle. Enter GESLER, OFFICERS, and SARNEM,
  with TELL in chains and guarded.

    SARNEM. Down, slave! Behold the governor.
  Down! down! and beg for mercy.

    GESLER. [Seated.] Does he hear?

    SAR. He does, but braves thy power.

    OFFICER. Why don’t you smite him for that look?

    GES. Can I believe
  My eyes?—He smiles! nay, grasps
  His chains as he would make a weapon of them
  To lay the smiter dead. [_To TELL._]
  Why speakest thou not?

    TELL. For wonder.

    GES. Wonder!

    TELL. Yes, that thou shouldst seem a man.

    GES. What should I seem?

    TELL. A monster!

    GES. Ha! Beware—think on thy chains.

    TELL. Though they were doubled, and did weigh me down
  Prostrate to earth, methinks I could rise up—
  Erect, with nothing but the honest pride
  Of telling thee, usurper,[501] to the teeth,
  Thou art a monster! Think upon my chains!
  How came they on me?

    GES. Darest thou question me?

    TELL. Darest thou answer.

    GES. Do I hear?

    TELL. Thou dost.

    GES. Beware my vengeance.

    TELL. Can it more than kill?

    GES. Enough—it can do that.

    TELL. No, not enough:
  It cannot take away the grace of life—
  Its comeliness[502] of look that virtue gives—
  Its port erect with consciousness[503] of truth—
  Its rich attire of honorable deeds—
  Its fair report that’s rife on good men’s tongues:
  It cannot lay its hands on these, no more
  Than it can pluck the brightness from the sun,
  Or with polluted finger tarnish it.

    GES. But it can make thee writhe.

    TELL. It may.

    GES. And groan.

    TELL. It may; and I may cry,
  Go on, though it should make me groan again.

    GES. Whence comest thou?

    TELL. From the mountains. Wouldst thou learn
  What news from them?

    GES. Canst tell me any?

    TELL. Ay; they[504] watch no more the avalanche.[505]

    GES. Why so?

    TELL. Because they look for thee. The hurricane
  Comes unawares upon them; from its bed
  The torrent breaks, and finds them in its track—

    GES. What do they then?

    TELL. Thank Heaven it is not thou!
  Thou hast perverted nature in them.
  There’s not a blessing Heaven vouchsafes[506] them but
  The thought of thee doth wither to a curse.

    GES. That’s right! I’d have them like their hills,
  That never smile, though wanton summer tempt
  Them e’er so much.

    TELL. But they do sometimes smile.

    GES. Ay?—when is that?

    TELL. When they do talk of vengeance.[507]

    GES. Vengeance! Dare they talk of that?

    TELL. Ay, and expect it too.

    GES. From whence?

    TELL. From Heaven!

    GES. From Heaven?

    TELL. And their true hands
  Are lifted up to it on every hill
  For justice on thee.

    GES. Where’s thy abode?

    TELL. I told thee—on the mountains.

    GES. Art married?

    TELL. Yes.

    GES. And hast a family?

    TELL. A son.

    GES. A son! Sarnem!

    SAR. My lord, the boy.

  [_GESLER signs to SARNEM to keep silence, and, whispering, sends
  him off._]

    TELL. The boy! What boy?
  Is’t mine?—and have they netted my young fledgling[508]?
  Now Heaven support me, if they have! He’ll own me,
  And share his father’s ruin! But a look
  Would put him on his guard—yet how to give it!
  Now, heart, thy nerve; forget thou art flesh; be rock.
  They come—they come!
  That step—that step—that little step, so light
  Upon the ground, how heavy does it fall
  Upon my heart! I feel my child!—

  _Enter SARNEM with ALBERT, whose eyes are rivetted on TELL’S bow, which
  SARNEM carries._

  ’Tis he!—We can but perish.

    SAR. See!

    ALBERT. What?

    SAR. Look there?

    ALB. I do. What would you have me see?

    SAR. Thy father.

    ALB. Who? That—that my father?

    TELL. [_Aside_] My boy—my boy!—my own brave boy,
  He’s safe!

    SAR. [_Aside to GESLER_] They’re like each other.

    GES. Yet I see no sign
  Of recognition[509] to betray the link
  Unites a father and his child.

    SAR. My lord,
  I am sure it is his father. Look at them.
  It may be
  A preconcerted[510] thing ’gainst such a chance,
  That they survey each other coldly thus.

    GES. We shall try. Lead forth the caitiff.[511]

    SAR. To a dungeon?

    GES. No; into the court.

    SAR. The court, my lord?

    GES. And send
  To tell the headsman[512] to make ready. Quick!
  The slave shall die!—You marked the boy?

    SAR. I did. He started—’tis his father.

    GES. We shall see. Away with him!

    TELL. Stop!—Stay!

    GES. What would you?

    TELL. Time!—a little time to call my thoughts together.

    GES. Thou shalt not have a minute.

    TELL. Some one, then, to speak with.

    GES. Hence with him!

    TELL. A moment!—Stop!
  Let me speak to the boy.

    GES. Is he thy son?

    TELL. And if
  He were, art thou so lost to nature as
  To send me forth to die before his face?

    GES. Well, speak with him.
  Now, Sarnem, mark them well.

    TELL. Thou dost not know me, boy—and well for thee
  Thou dost not. I’m the father of a son
  About thy age. Thou,
  I see, wast born like him, upon the hills;
  If thou shouldst ’scape thy present thraldom, he
  May chance to cross thee; if he should, I pray thee
  Relate to him what has been passing here,
  And say I laid my hand upon thy head,
  And said to thee,—if he were here, as thou art,
  Thus would I bless him. May’st thou live my boy,
  To see thy country free, or die for her,
  As I do!                         [_ALBERT weeps._

    SAR. Mark! he weeps.

    TELL. Were he my son,
  He would not shed a tear. He would remember
  The cliff where he was bred, and learned to scan
  A thousand fathoms’ depth of nether[513] air;
  Where he was trained to hear the thunder talk,
  And meet the lightning, eye to eye, where last
  We spoke together, when I told him death
  Bestowed the brightest gem that graces life,
  Embraced for virtue’s sake. He shed a tear!
  No; were he by, I’d talk to him, and his cheek
  Should never blanch, nor moisture dim his eye,—
  I’d talk to him—

    SAR. He falters!

    TELL. ’Tis too much!
  And yet it must be done! I’d talk to him—

    GES. Of what?

    TELL. The mother, tyrant, thou dost make
  A widow of. I’d talk to him of her.
  I’d bid him tell her, next to liberty,
  Her name was the last my lips pronounced.
  And I would charge him never to forget
  To love and cherish her, as he would have
  His father’s dying blessing rest upon him.

    SAR. You see, as he doth prompt, the other acts.

    TELL. [_Aside._] So well he bears it, he doth vanquish me.
  My boy! my boy! O, for the hills, the hills—
  To see him bound along their tops again,
  With liberty.

    SAR. Was there not all the father in that look?

    GES. Yet, ’tis ’gainst nature.

    SAR. Not if he believes
  To own the son would be to make him share
  The father’s death.

    GES. I did not think of that! [_To TELL._] ’Tis well
  The boy is not thy son. I’ve destined him
  To die along with thee.

    TELL. To die? For what?

    GES. For having braved my power, as thou hast.
  Lead them forth.

    TELL. He’s but a child.

    GES. Away with them!

    TELL. Perhaps an only child.

    GES. No matter.

    TELL. He may have a mother.

    GES. So the viper hath;
  And yet, who spares it for the mother’s sake?

    TELL. I talk to stone. I talk to it as though
  ’Twere flesh; and know ’tis none. I’ll talk to it
  No more. Come my boy!
  I taught thee how to live—I’ll show thee how to die.

LXX.—THE PRESUMPTION OF YOUTH.

ROLLIN.

  Charles Rollin was born at Paris, January 30, 1661, and died
  September 14, 1741. His father, who was a cutler, intended him to
  follow his own trade; but through the kindness of a Benedictine
  monk, he was educated at the college of Plesseis. He afterward
  became Rector of the University of Paris. His “Ancient History,”
  a work of considerable merit, continues still to be republished
  and extensively read.


1. The young people of Athens, amazed at the glory of Themistocles,[514]
of Cimon[515] of Pericles,[516] and full of a foolish ambition, after
having received some lessons from the sophists,[517] who promised to
render them very great politicians, believed themselves capable of
every thing, and aspired to fill the highest places. One of them, named
Glaucon, took it so strongly in his head that he had a _peculiar genius_
for public affairs, although he was not yet twenty years of age, that no
person in his family, nor among his friends, had the power to divert him
from a notion so little befitting his age and capacity.

2. Socrates, who liked him on account of Plato,[518] his brother, was
the only one who succeeded in making him change his resolution. Meeting
him one day, he accosted[519] him with so dexterous a discourse that
he induced[520] him to listen. He had already gained much influence
over him. “You have a desire to govern the republic?” said Socrates.
“True,” replied Glaucon. “You can not have a finer design,” said the
philosopher,[521] “since, if you succeed in it, you will be in a state to
serve your friends, to enlarge your house, and to extend the limits of
your native country.”

3. “You will become known not only in Athens but through all Greece, and
it may be that your renown, like that of Themistocles, will reach even
to the barbarous[522] nations. At last, you will gain the respect and
admiration of everybody.” A beginning so flattering pleased the young man
exceedingly, and he very willingly continued the conversation. “Since
you desire to make yourself esteemed and respected, it is clear that you
think to render yourself useful to the public.” “Assuredly.” “Tell me,
then, I beseech you, what is the first service that you intend to render
the state?”

4. As Glaucon appeared to be perplexed, and considered what he ought
to answer,—“Probably,” replied Socrates, “it will be to enrich the
republic, that is to say, to increase its revenues.” “Exactly so.” “And,
undoubtedly, you know in what the revenues of the state consist, and the
extent to which they may be increased. You will not have failed to make
it a private study, to the end that if one source should suddenly fail,
you may be able to supply its place immediately with another.” “I assure
you,” answered Glaucon, “that this is what I have never thought of.”

5. “Tell me, at least, then, the necessary expenses of maintaining
the republic. You can not fail to know of what importance it is to
retrench[523] those which are superfluous[524].” “I confess to you that I
am not more instructed with regard to this article than the other.” “Then
it is necessary to defer till another time the design that you have of
enriching the republic; for it is impossible for you to benefit the state
while you are ignorant of its revenues and expenses.”

6. “But,” said Glaucon, “there is still another means that you pass over
in silence; one can enrich a state by the ruin of its enemies.” “You
are right,” replied Socrates; “but in order to do that, you must be
the more powerful; otherwise you run the risk of losing that which you
possess. So, he who speaks of undertaking a war, ought to know the power
of both parties, to the end that if he finds his party the stronger, he
may boldly risk the adventure; but, if he find it the weaker, he should
dissuade the people from undertaking it.”

7. “But, do you know what are the forces of our republic, by sea and by
land, and what are those of our enemies? Have you a statement of them in
writing? You will do me the pleasure to allow me a perusal of it.” “I
have none yet,” replied Glaucon. “I see, then,” said Socrates, “that we
shall not make war so soon, if they intrust _you_ with the government;
for there remain many things for you to know, and many cares to take.”

8. The sage mentioned many other articles, not less important, in which
he found Glaucon equally inexperienced, and he pointed out how ridiculous
they render themselves, who have the rashness to intermeddle with
government, without bringing any other preparation to the task than _a
great degree of self-esteem and excessive ambition_. “Fear, my dear
Glaucon,” said Socrates, “fear, lest a too ardent desire for honors
should blind you; and cause you to take a part that would cover you with
shame, in bringing to light your incapacity,[525] and want of talent.”

9. The youth was wise enough to profit by the good advice of his
instructor, and took some time to gain private information, before he
ventured to appear in public. This lesson is for all ages.

LXXI.—MARY MAGDALEN.

CALLANAN.

  J. J. Callanan was born in Cork, Ireland, in 1795. He was an
  associate of Dr. Maginn, and, through him, became a contributor
  to “Blackwood’s Magazine.” He died in Lisbon in 1829.


  1. To the hall of that feast came the sinful and fair;
    She heard in the city that Jesus was there;
    She marked not the splendor that blazed on their board,
    But silently knelt at the feet of her Lord.

  2. The hair from her forehead, so sad and so meek,
    Hung dark o’er the blushes that burn’d on her cheek;
    And so still and so lowly she bent in her shame,
    It seemed as her spirit had flown from its frame.

  3. The frown and the murmur went round through them all,
    That one so unhallowed should tread in that hall;
    And some said the poor would be objects more meet,
    For the wealth of the perfumes she showered at his feet.

  4. She marked but her Saviour, she spoke but in sighs,
    She dared not look up to the heaven of his eyes;
    And the hot tears gushed forth at each heave of her breast,
    As her lips to his sandals she throbbingly pressed.

  5. On the cloud after tempests, as shineth the bow,
    In the glance of the sunbeam, as melteth the snow,
    He looked on that lost one—her sins were forgiven;
    And Mary went forth in the beauty of heaven.




LXXII.—THE WEXFORD MASSACRE.

  The Mayor and Governor offered to capitulate; but whilst
  their Commissioners were treating with Cromwell, an officer
  perfidiously opened the castle to the enemy; the adjacent wall
  was immediately scaled, and after a stubborn but unavailing
  resistance in the Marketplace, Wexford was abandoned to the
  mercy of the assailants. The tragedy so recently acted at
  Drogheda was renewed. No distinction was made between the
  defenceless inhabitants and the armed soldiers; nor could the
  shrieks and prayers of three hundred females, who had gathered
  around the great Cross, preserve them from these ruthless
  barbarians.—LINGARD’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND: New York Edition, vol.
  10, p. 297.


  1. They knelt around the Cross divine,
      The matron and the maid—
    They bowed before redemption’s sign
      And fervently they prayed—
    Three hundred fair and helpless ones,
      Whose crime was this alone—
    Their valiant husbands, sires, and sons,
      Had battled for their own.

  2. Had battled bravely, but in vain—
      The Saxon won the fight;
    And Irish corses strewed the plain
      Where valor slept with Right.
    And now that man of demon guilt
      To fated Wexford flew—
    The red blood reeking on his hilt,
      Of hearts to Erin true!

  3. He found them there—the young, the old—
      The maiden and the wife;
    Their guardians brave, in death were cold,
      Who dared for _them_ the strife—
    They prayed for mercy. God on high!
      Before Thy cross they prayed,
    And ruthless Cromwell bade them die
      To glut the Saxon blade.

  4. Three hundred fell—the stifled prayer
      Was quenched in woman’s blood;
    Nor youth nor age could move to spare
      From slaughter’s crimson flood.
    But nations keep a stern account
      Of deeds that tyrants do;
    And guiltless blood to Heaven will mount,
      And heaven avenge it too.

  Doctor Samuel Johnson, born 1709, died 1784, was distinguished as
  an essayist and lexicographer.


1. Obidah, the son of Abensina, left the caravansary[526] early in the
morning, and pursued his journey through the plains of Indostan. He was
fresh and vigorous with rest; he was animated with hope; he was incited
by desire; he walked swiftly forward over the valleys, and saw the hills
gradually rising before him.

2. As he passed along, his ears were delighted with the morning song
of the bird of paradise, he was fanned by the last flutter of the
sinking breeze, and sprinkled with dew by groves of spices; he sometimes
contemplated the towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and
sometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primrose, eldest daughter
of the spring: all his senses were gratified, and all care was banished
from his heart.

3. Thus he went on till the sun approached his meridian,[527] and the
increasing heat preyed upon his strength; he then looked round about him
for some more commodious path. He saw, on his right hand, a grove that
seemed to wave its shades as a sign of invitation: he entered it, and
found the coolness and verdure irresistibly pleasant.

4. He did not, however, forget whither he was traveling, but found a
narrow way, bordered with flowers, which appeared to have the same
direction with the main road, and was pleased, that, by this happy
experiment, he had found means to unite pleasure with business, and
to gain the reward of diligence without suffering its fatigues. He,
therefore, still continued to walk, for a time, without the least
remission[528] of his ardor, except that he was sometimes tempted to stop
by the music of the birds, whom the heat had assembled in the shade, and
sometimes amused himself with plucking the flowers that covered the bank
on either side, or the fruits that hung upon the branches.

5. At last, the green path began to decline from its first tendency, and
to wind among hills and thickets, cooled with fountains, and murmuring
with waterfalls. Here Obidah paused for a time, and began to consider
whether it were longer safe to forsake the known and common track, but
remembering that the heat was now in its greatest violence, and that the
plain was dusty and uneven, he resolved to pursue the new path, which
he supposed only to make a few meanders,[529] in compliance with the
varieties of the ground, and to end at last in the common road.

6. Having thus calmed his solicitude, he renewed his pace, though he
suspected he was not gaining ground. This uneasiness of his mind inclined
him to lay hold on every new object, and give way to every sensation
that might soothe or divert him. He listened to every echo, he mounted
every hill for a fresh prospect, he turned aside to every cascade,[530]
and pleased himself with tracing the course of a gentle river, that
rolled among the trees, and watered a large region, with innumerable
circumlocutions.[531]

7. In these amusements the hours passed away unaccounted, his
deviations[532] had perplexed his memory, and he knew not toward
what point to travel. He stood pensive[533] and confused, afraid to
go forward, lest he should go wrong, yet conscious that the time of
loitering was now past. While he was thus tortured with uncertainty, the
sky was overspread with clouds, the day vanished from before him, and a
sudden tempest gathered round his head.

8. He was now roused by his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of
his folly; he now saw how happiness is lost when ease is consulted; he
lamented the unmanly impatience that prompted him to seek shelter in the
grove, and despised the petty curiosity that led him on from trifle to
trifle. While he was thus reflecting, the air grew blacker, and a clap of
thunder broke his meditation.[534]

9. He now resolved to do what remained yet in his power, to tread back
the ground which he had passed, and try to find some issue, where the
wood might open into the plain. He prostrated himself upon the ground,
and commended his life to the Lord of nature.

10. He rose with confidence and tranquillity,[535] and pressed on with
his saber in his hand; for the beasts of the desert were in motion,
and on every hand were heard the mingled howls of rage and fear, and
ravage[536] and expiration:[537] all the horrors of darkness and solitude
surrounded him:—the wind roared in the woods, and the torrents tumbled
from the hills.

11. Thus forlorn and distressed, he wandered through the wild, without
knowing whither he was going, or whether he was every moment drawing
nearer to safety or to destruction. At length, not fear but labor began
to overcome him; his breath grew short, and his knees trembled, and he
was on the point of lying down, in resignation to his fate, when he
beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He advanced toward
the light, and finding that it proceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he
called humbly at the door, and obtained admission. The old man set before
him such provisions as he had collected for himself, on which Obidah fed
with eagerness and gratitude.

12. When the repast was over, “Tell me,” said the hermit, “by what
chance thou hast been brought hither; I have been now twenty years an
inhabitant of the wilderness, in which I never saw a man before.” Obidah
then related the occurrences of his journey, without any concealment or
palliation.[538]

13 “Son,” said the hermit, “let the errors and follies, the dangers and
escapes of this day, sink deep into thy heart. Remember, my son, that
human life is the journey of a day. We rise in the morning of youth, full
of vigor, and full of expectation; we set forward with spirit and hope,
with gayety and with diligence, and travel on awhile in the straight road
of piety, toward the mansion of rest.

14. “In a short time we remit our fervor, and endeavor to find some
mitigation[539] of our duty, and some more easy means of obtaining the
same end. We then relax our vigor, and resolve no longer to be terrified
with crimes at a distance, but rely upon our own constancy,[540] and
venture to approach what we resolve never to touch.

15. “We thus enter the bowers of ease, and repose in the shades of
security. Here the heart softens, and vigilance[541] subsides;[542] we
are then willing to inquire whether another advance cannot be made, and
whether we may not, at least, turn our eyes upon the gardens of pleasure.
We approach them with scruple and hesitation; we enter them, but enter
timorous and trembling, and always hope to pass through them without
losing the road of virtue, which we for awhile keep in our sight, and
to which we propose to return. But temptation succeeds temptation, and
one compliance prepares us for another; we in time lose the happiness of
innocence, and solace[543] our disquiet with sensual[544] gratifications.

16. “By degrees we let fall the remembrance of our original intention,
and quit the only adequate[545] object of rational desire. We entangle
ourselves in business, immerge ourselves in luxury, and rove through the
labyrinths[546] of inconstancy,[547] till the darkness of old age begins
to invade us, and disease and anxiety obstruct our way. We then look back
upon our lives with horror, with sorrow, with repentance; and wish, but
too often vainly wish, that we had not forsaken the ways of virtue.

17. “Happy are they, my son, who shall learn from thy example not to
despair, but shall remember, that though the day is past, and their
strength is wasted, there yet remains one effort to be made; that
reformation is never hopeless, nor sincere endeavors ever unassisted;
that the wanderer may at length return, after all his errors; and that
he who implores strength and courage from above, shall find danger and
difficulty give way before him. Go now, my son, to thy repose; commit
thyself to the care of Omnipotence;[548] and when the morning comes again
to toil, begin anew thy journey and thy life.”

LXXIV.—THE DOUBTING HEART.

ADELAIDE A. PROCTOR.


  FIRST VOICE.

      1. Where are the swallows fled?
          Frozen and dead,
  Perchance, upon some bleak and stormy shore.

  SECOND VOICE.

          O doubting heart!
        Far over purple seas,
        They wait, in sunny ease,
        The balmy southern breeze,
  To bring them to their northern home once more.

  FIRST VOICE.

      2. Why must the flowers die?
          Poisoned they lie
  In the cold tomb, heedless of tears or rain.

  SECOND VOICE.

          O doubting heart!

        The sky is overcast,
        Yet stars shall rise at last,
        Brighter for darkness past,
  And angels’ silver voices stir the air.




LXXV.—ON THE WASTE OF TIME.

FRANKLIN.

  Benjamin Franklin, distinguished as a statesman, a patriot, and a
  philosopher, was born at Boston in 1706. He began his career as
  a printer, and by diligence, integrity and rare sagacity, became
  one of the foremost of that able and brilliant band of men who
  were the leaders of the American Revolution. He died in 1790.


1. Amergus was a gentleman of good estate: he was bred to no business,
and could not contrive how to waste his hours agreeably; he had no relish
for any of the proper works of life, nor any taste for the improvement
of the mind; he spent generally ten hours of the four-and-twenty in bed;
he dozed away two or three more on his couch; and as many more were
dissolved in good liquor every evening, if he met with company of his own
humor. Thus he made a shift to wear off ten years of his life since the
paternal[549] estate fell into his hands.

2. One evening as he was musing alone, his thoughts happened to take
a most unusual turn, for they cast a glance backward, and he began to
reflect on his manner of life. He bethought himself what a number of
living beings had been made a sacrifice[550] to support his carcass, and
how much corn and wine had been mingled with these offerings; and he set
himself to compute what he had devoured since he came to the age of man.

3. “About a dozen feathered creatures, small and great, have, one week
with another,” said he, “given up their lives to prolong mine, which,
in ten years, amounts to at least six thousand. Fifty sheep have been
sacrificed in a year, with half a hecatomb[551] of black-cattle,[552]
that I might have the choicest parts offered weekly upon my table. Thus
a thousand beasts, out of the flock and the herd, have been slain in ten
years’ time to feed me beside what the forest has supplied me with.

4. “Many hundreds of fishes have, in all their variety, been robbed
of life for my repast,[553] and of the smaller fry, some thousands. A
measure of corn would hardly suffice[554] me fine flour enough for a
month’s provision, and this arises to about six score bushels; and many
hogsheads of wine and other liquors have passed through this body of
mine—this wretched strainer of meat and drink! And what have I done all
this time for God and man? What a vast profusion[555] of good things
wasted upon a useless life and a worthless liver!

5. “There is not the meanest creature among all those that I have
devoured, but hath answered the end of its creation better than I. It was
made to support human nature, and it has done so. Every crab and oyster I
have eaten, and every grain of corn I have devoured, hath filled up its
place in the rank of beings with more propriety and honor than I have
done. Oh, shameful waste of life and time!”

6. In short, he carried on his moral reflections[556] with so just and
severe a force of reason, as constrained[557] him to change his whole
course of life; to break off his follies at once, and to apply himself to
gain some useful knowledge, when he was more than thirty years of age.
He lived many following years, with the character of a worthy man and an
excellent Christian;[558] he died with a peaceful conscience,[559] and
the tears of his country were dropped upon his tomb.

7. The world, that knew the whole series of his life, were amazed at
the mighty change. They beheld him as a wonder of reformation, while
he himself confessed and adored the Divine power and mercy which had
transformed him from a brute to a man. But this was a single instance,
and we may almost venture to write _miracle_[560] upon it. Are there
not numbers, in this degenerate[561] age, whose lives thus run to utter
waste, without the least tendency[562] to usefulness?

[549] PA-TERˊ-NAL, belonging to or derived from one’s father.

[550] SACˊ-RI-FICE, destruction or surrender of anything, made for the
sake of something else; the thing destroyed or given up.

[551] HECˊ-A-TOMB, the sacrifice of a hundred.

[552] BLACKˊ-CAT-TLE, cows, bulls, and oxen, as distinguished from sheep
and goats, which are called small cattle.

meal; victuals.

LXXVI.—THE REAPER, DEATH.

LONGFELLOW.


  1. There is a reaper, whose name is Death,
      And, with his sickle keen,
    He reaps the bearded grain at a breath,
      And the flowers that grow between.

  2. “Shall I have nought that is fair?” saith he;
      “Have nought but the bearded grain?
    Though the breath of these flowers is sweet to me,
      I will give them all back again.”

  3. He gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes,
      He kissed their drooping leaves;
    It was for the Lord of Paradise
      He bound them in his sheaves.

  4. “My Lord has need of these flowerets gay,”
      The reaper said, and smiled;
    “Dear tokens of the earth are they,
      Where he was once a child.

  5. “They all shall bloom in fields of light,
      Transplanted by my care,
    And saints, upon their garments white,
      These sacred blossoms wear.”

  6. Oh, not in cruelty, not in wrath,
      The reaper came that day;
    ’Twas an angel visited the earth,
      And took the flowers away.




LXXVII.—DIALOGUE WITH THE GOUT.

FRANKLIN.


1. _Franklin._ Eh! Oh! Eh! What have I done to merit these cruel
sufferings?

_Gout._ Many things: you have ate and drank too freely, and too much
indulged those legs of yours in their indolence.[563]

_Franklin._ Who is it that accuses me?

_Gout._ It is I, even I, the Gout.

_Franklin._ What! my enemy in person?

_Gout._ No; not your enemy.

_Franklin._ I repeat it, my enemy; for you would not only torment[564]
my body to death, but ruin my good name. You reproach me as a glutton
and a tippler;[565] now all the world that knows me will allow that I am
neither the one nor the other.

2. _Gout._ The world may think as it pleases. It is always very
complaisant[566] to itself, and sometimes to its friends; but I very
well know that the quantity of meat and drink proper for a man who takes
a reasonable degree of exercise would be too much for another who never
takes any.

_Franklin._ I take—Eh! Oh!—as much exercise—Eh!—as I can, Madam Gout. You
know my sedentary[567] state; and on that account, it would seem, Madam
Gout, as if you might spare me a little, seeing it is not altogether my
own fault.

3. _Gout._ Not a jot; your rhetoric and your politeness are thrown away;
your apology avails nothing. If your situation in life is a sedentary
one, your amusements, your recreations, at least, should be active. You
ought to walk or ride; or if the weather prevents that, play at something.

But let us examine your course of life. While the mornings are long, and
you have leisure to go abroad, what do you do? Why, instead of gaining
an appetite for breakfast, by salutary exercise, you amuse yourself
with books, pamphlets, or newspapers, which commonly are not worth the
reading. Yet you eat an inordinate breakfast: four dishes of tea, with
cream, one or two buttered toasts, with slices of hung beef; which I
fancy are not things the most easily digested.

4. Immediately afterward, you sit down to write at your desk, or converse
with persons who apply to you on business. Thus the time passes till
one, without any kind of bodily exercise. But all this I could pardon,
in regard, as you say, to your sedentary condition; but what is your
practice after dinner? Walking in the beautiful gardens of those friends
with whom you have dined would be the choice of men of sense; yours is
to be fixed down to chess, where you are found engaged for two or three
hours.

5. This is your perpetual recreation; the least eligible[568] of any
for a sedentary man, because, instead of accelerating[569] the motion
of the fluids, the rigid[570] attention it requires helps to retard
the circulation and obstruct internal secretions.[571] Wrapt in the
speculations of this wretched game, you destroy your constitution.
What can be expected from such a course of living but a body replete
with stagnant humors, ready to fall a prey to all kinds of dangerous
maladies,[572] if I, the Gout, did not occasionally bring you relief by
agitating those humors, and so purifying or dissipating them? Fie, then,
Mr. Franklin! But, amidst my instructions, I had almost forgotten to
administer my wholesome corrections; so take that twinge, and that.

6. _Franklin._ Oh! Eh! Oh! Oh! As much instruction as you please,
Madam Gout, and as many reproaches; but pray, Madam, a truce with your
corrections!

_Gout._ No, sir, no; I will not abate a particle of what is so much for
your good, therefore—

_Franklin._ Oh! Eh! It is not fair to say I take no exercise, when I do,
very often, go out to dine, and return in my carriage.

7. _Gout._ That, of all imaginable exercises, is the most slight and
insignificant, if you allude to the motion of a carriage suspended
on springs. By observing the degree of heat obtained from different
kinds of motion, we may form an estimate of the quantity of exercise
given by each. Thus, for example, if you turn out to walk in winter
with cold feet, in an hour’s time you will be in a glow all over;
ride on horseback, the same effect will scarcely be perceived by four
hours’ round trotting; but if you loll in a carriage, such as you have
mentioned, you may travel all day, and gladly enter the last inn to warm
your feet by a fire.

8. Flatter yourself, then, no longer, that half an hour’s airing in your
carriage deserves the name of exercise. Providence has appointed few to
roll in carriages, while he has given to all a pair of legs, which are
machines infinitely more commodious and serviceable. Be grateful, then,
and make a proper use of yours.

LXXVIII.—THE DEATH OF THE FLOWERS.

WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.


  1. The melancholy days[573] are come, the saddest of the year,
    Of wailing[574] winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown and sear.
    Heaped in the hollows of the grove, the withered leaves lie dead;
    They rustle to the eddying[575] gust, and to the rabbit’s tread.
    The robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrub the jay,
    And from the wood-top caws[576] the crow, through all the gloomy day.

  2. Where are the flowers, the fair young flowers, that lately sprung and
        stood
    In brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood?
    Alas! they all are in their graves; the gentle race of flowers
    Are lying in their lowly bed, with the fair and good of ours.
    The rain is falling where they lie; but the cold November rain
    Calls not from out the gloomy earth the lovely ones again.

  3. The wind-flower and the violet, they perished long ago,
    And the wild-rose and the orchis died amid the summer glow;
    But on the hill the golden-rod, and the aster in the wood,
    And the yellow sun-flower by the brook, in autumn beauty stood,
    Till fell the frost from the clear cold heaven, as falls the plague
        on men,
    And the brightness of their smile was gone from upland, glade,[577]
        and glen.[578]

  4. And now, when comes the calm, mild day, as still such days will come,
    To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home,
    When the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are
        still,
    And twinkle in the smoky light, the waters of the rill,
    The south wind searches for the flowers, whose fragrance late he bore,
    And sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more.

  5. And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died,
    The fair, meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side;
    In the cold, moist earth we laid her, when the forest cast the leaf,
    And we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief;
    Yet not unmeet it was that one, like that young friend of ours,
    So gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers.

[578] GLEN, a retired and narrow valley; a narrow space between hills.




LXXIX.—EDWARD THE CONFESSOR.

LINGARD.

  John Lingard, D. D., was born in England in 1771; died in 1851.
  With the completion of the “History of England,” which has been
  republished in New York in thirteen volumes, the literary fame
  of Dr. Lingard became established throughout Europe. Cardinal
  Wiseman speaks of this history, and its learned author, in the
  following terms: “It is a Providence that in history we have had
  given to the nation a writer like Lingard, whose gigantic merit
  will be better appreciated in each successive generation, as it
  sees his work standing calm and erect amidst the shoals of petty
  pretenders to usurp his station. When Hume shall have fairly
  taken his place among the classical writers of our tongue, and
  Macaulay shall have been transferred to the shelves of romances
  and poets, and each thus have received his due meed of praise,
  then Lingard will be still more conspicuous as the only impartial
  historian of our country.”


1. If we estimate the character of a sovereign by the test of popular
affection, we must rank Edward among the best princes of his time. The
goodness of his heart was adored by his subjects, who lamented his death
with tears of undissembled grief, and bequeathed his memory as an object
of veneration to their posterity. The blessings of his reign are the
constant theme of our ancient writers: not, indeed, that he displayed any
of those brilliant qualities which attract admiration, while they inflict
misery.

2. He could not boast of the victories which he had achieved; but he
exhibited the interesting spectacle of a king, negligent of his private
interests, and wholly devoted to the welfare of his people; and, by
his labors to restore the dominion of the laws, his vigilance to ward
off foreign aggression, his constant, and ultimately successful,
solicitude to appease the feuds of his nobles,—if he did not prevent
the interruption, he secured, at least, a longer duration of public
tranquillity, than had been enjoyed in England for half a century.

3. He was pious, kind, and compassionate; the father of the poor, and
the protector of the weak; more willing to give than to receive, the
better pleased to pardon than to punish. Under the preceding kings, force
generally supplied the place of justice, and the people were impoverished
by the rapacity of the sovereign. But Edward enforced the laws of his
Saxon predecessors, and disdained the riches that were wrung from the
labors of his subjects.

4. Temperate in his diet, unostentatious in his person, pursuing no
pleasures but those which his hawks and hounds afforded, he was content
with the patrimonial domains of the crown; and was able to assert,
even after the abolition of that fruitful source of revenue, the
Danegelt, that he possessed a greater portion of wealth than any of his
predecessors enjoyed. To him, the principle that the king can do no
wrong, was literally applied by the gratitude of his people, who, if they
occasionally complained of the measures of the government, attributed the
blame not to the monarch himself, of whose benevolence they entertained
no doubt, but to the ministers, who had abused his confidence, or
deceived his credulity.

5. It was, however, a fortunate circumstance for the memory of Edward,
that he occupied the interval between the Danish and Norman conquests.
Writers were induced to view his character with more partiality, from
the hatred with which they looked upon his successors and predecessors.
They were foreigners; he was a native: they held the crown by conquest;
he by descent: they ground to the dust the slaves whom they had made; he
became known to his countrymen only by his benefits. Hence he appeared
to shine with purer light amid the gloom with which he was surrounded;
and whenever the people under the despotism of the Norman kings, had any
opportunity of expressing their real wishes, they constantly called for
“the laws and customs of the good King Edward”.




LXXX.—THE COMING OF WINTER.

T. B. READ.


  1. Autumn’s sighing,
    Moaning, dying,
    Clouds are flying
      On like steeds;
    While their shadows
    O’er the meadows,
    Walk like widows
      Decked in weeds.

  2. Red leaves trailing,
    Fall unfailing,
    Dropping, sailing,
      From the wood,
    That, unpliant,
    Stands defiant,
    Like a giant,
      Dropping blood.

  3. Winds are swelling
    Round our dwelling,
    All day telling
      Us their woe;
    And, at vesper,
    Frosts grow crisper,
    As they whisper
      Of the snow.

  4. From the unseen land,
    Frozen inland,
    Down from Greenland,
      Winter glides.
    Shedding lightness
    Like the brightness
    When moon-whiteness
      Fills the tide.

  5. Now bright Pleasure’s
    Sparkling measures
    With rare treasures
      Overflow!
    With this gladness
    Comes what sadness
    Oh, what sadness,
      Oh, what woe!

  6. Even merit
    May inherit
    Some bare garret,
      Or the ground;
    Or, a worse ill,
    Beg a morsel
    At some door-sill,
      Like a hound.

  7. Storms are trailing,
    Winds are wailing,
    Howling, railing,
      At each door.
    ’Midst this trailing,
    Howling, railing,
    List the wailing
      Of the poor!




LXXXI.—THE SISTER OF CHARITY.

WILLIAMS.

  Richard Dalton Williams was born in Ireland. He had been for
  several years previous to his death, Professor of Belles
  Letters in the Catholic College, Mobile. His poems all bear the
  unmistakable stamp of poetic genius.


  1. Sister of Charity, gentle and dutiful,
      Loving as seraphim, tender and mild,
    In humbleness strong, and in purity beautiful,
      In spirit heroic, in manners a child,
    Ever thy love like an angel reposes,—
      With hovering wings o’er the sufferer here,
    Till the arrows of death are half-hidden in roses,
      And hope-speaking prophecy smiles on the bier.

  2. When life, like a vapor, is slowly retiring,
      As clouds in the dawning to heaven uprolled,
    Thy prayer, like a herald, precedes him expiring,
      And the Cross on thy bosom his last looks behold;
    And O! as the Spouse to thy words of love listens,
      What hundredfold blessings descend on thee then—
    Thus the flower-absorbed dew in the bright iris glistens,
      And returns to the lilies more richly again.

  3. Sister of Charity, child of the holiest,
      O, for thy living soul, ardent as pure—
    Mother of orphans and friend of the lowliest—
      Stay of the wretched, the guilty, the poor;
    The embrace of the Godhead so plainly enfolds thee
      Sanctity’s halo so shrines thee around,
    Daring the eye that unshrinking beholds thee,
      Nor droops in thy presence abashed to the ground.

  4. Dim is the fire of the sunniest blushes,
      Burning the breast of the maidenly rose
    To the exquisite bloom that thy pale beauty flushes,
      When the incense ascends and the sanctuary glows,
    And the music, that seems heaven’s language, is pealing—
      Adoration has bowed him in silence and sighs,
    And man, intermingled with angels, is feeling
      The passionless rapture that comes from the skies.

  5. O, that this heart, whose unspeakable treasure
      Of love hath been wasted so vainly on clay,
    Like thine, unallured by the phantom of pleasure,
      Could rend every earthly affection away.
    And yet, in thy presence, the billows subsiding
      Obey the strong effort of reason and will,
    And my soul, in her pristine tranquillity gliding,
      Is calm as when God bade the ocean be still.

  6. Thy soothing, how gentle! thy pity, how tender!
      Choir-music thy voice is—thy step angel grace,
    And thy union with deity shrines in a splendor
      Subdued, but unearthly, thy spiritual face.
    When the frail chains are broken, a captive that bound thee,
      Afar from thy home is the prison of clay,
    Bride of the Lamb, and earth’s shadows around thee
      Disperse in the blaze of eternity’s day.

  7. Still mindful, as now, of the sufferer’s story,
      Arresting the thunders of wrath ere they roll,
    Intervene as a cloud between us and His glory,
      And shield from His lightnings the shuddering soul.
    As mild as the moonbeam in autumn descending
      That lightning, extinguished by mercy, shall fall,
    While he hears, with the wail of a penitent blending,
      Thy prayer, Holy Daughter of Vincent de Paul.




LXXXII.—WASHINGTON AND BONAPARTE COMPARED.

CHATEAUBRIAND.


1. If Washington and Bonaparte are compared, man with man, the genius of
the first will seem to take a less lofty flight than that of the second.
Washington belongs not, like Bonaparte, to the race of Alexanders and
Cæsars, who surpassed the ordinary stature of the human race; he creates
no sentiment of astonishment; he is not seen contending, on a vast
theatre, for glory, with the greatest captains and most powerful monarchs
of the earth, he traverses[579] no seas; he hurries not from Memphis
to Vienna, from Cadiz to Moscow; his work is a simple one of defending
himself, with a handful of citizens, within the narrow limits of domestic
hearths, in a land without a past and without celebrity.

2. He gains none of those battles which renew the bloody triumphs of
Arbela[580] and Pharsalia;[581] he puts not his foot upon the necks of
kings; he does not say to them, waiting on the vestibule of his palace,
_how often you come!_ and how you weary Attila![582] A certain spirit of
silence envelops the actions of Washington: slow caution marks them all.
One would say that he had ever the sentiment of his great mission with
him, and that he feared to compromise it by rashness.

3. His own personal destiny seems not to have entered into the
calculations of this hero of a new species; the destinies of his country
alone occupied him, and he did not permit himself to risk or gamble
with what did not belong to him. But from this profound obscurity what
light breaks forth! Seek through the unknown forests where the sword of
Washington glittered, and what will you find there? Tombs? No! A world.
Washington has left the United States as a trophy of his field of battle.

4. Bonaparte possessed no single trait of this great American. His wars
were all waged on an ancient continent, environed[583] by splendor and
stunning with noise. His object was personal glory: his individual
destiny filled all his thoughts. He seems to have known that his mission
would be short: that the torrent that fell from such a height would
quickly expend its force. He hurried forward to enjoy and to abuse his
glory, as if aware that it was a fugitive dream of youth. Like the gods
of Homer, four steps must suffice him to reach the end of the world.

5. Each of these men has been recompensed according to his works.
Washington, after having raised a nation to independence, slept
peacefully, as a retired magistrate, under his paternal roof, amid the
regrets of his countrymen, and the veneration of all people, Bonaparte,
having robbed a nation of its independence was hurled, a dethroned
emperor, into exile, and the terrified earth hardly thought him secure
enough under the custody of the ocean.

6. Even while exhausted and chained to a rock, he was struggling with
death: Europe dared not lay down her arms, for fear of him. He died;
and this event, published at the gate of the palace before which
the conqueror had proclaimed so many funerals, hardly arrested the
passer-by. What, indeed, had citizens to weep for!

7. Washington and Bonaparte both arose out of the bosom of a republic.
Both were born of liberty; the first was faithful to it, the second
betrayed it. Their lot will be according to the different part they
chose: very different with future generations. The name of Washington
will spread with liberty from age to age, and mark the commencement of
a new era for the human race: the name of Bonaparte will be pronounced
also by distant generations, but no benedictions will be attached to it;
it will serve on the contrary, as an authority to oppressors, great and
petty of all times.

8. Washington represented completely the wants, the ideas, the state
of enlightenment and opinions of his epoch. He seconded, instead of
thwarting, the advancing movement: he willed that which he ought to have
willed; the fulfilment of the mission to which he was called. Hence the
coherence[584] and perpetuity of his work.

9. This man, who strikes the imagination so slightly, because he was
natural, and kept within his just proportions, has confounded his history
with that of his country: his glory is the common patrimony of increased
civilization: his renown rises like one of those sanctuaries whence a
stream, pure and inexhaustible, flows forth for ever, for the solace of
the people.

10. Bonaparte might also have enriched the public domain. His action was
on the nation the most civilized, the most intelligent, the most brave,
the most brilliant of the earth. What a rank would he have occupied at
present in the universe, if he had joined magnanimity to his other heroic
qualities! if—Washington and Bonaparte at the same time—he had nominated
liberty the inheritor of his glory!

11. But the disproportioned giant did not completely identify his destiny
with that of his country. His genius belonged to modern, his ambition
to ancient times. He did not perceive that the miracles of his life by
far surpassed the value of a diadem, and that this gothic ornament but
ill became him. Sometimes one might see him take a step with the age; at
others he would retrograde toward the past. But whether he reascended the
stream of time or followed its course, the prodigious force of his genius
seemed to command a flow or a flux at his will.

12. Men were, in his eyes, only a means of power: there was no sympathy
between their welfare and his own. He promised to liberate, and he
enchained them: he separated himself from them, and they shrunk back from
him. The kings of Egypt built their funeral pyramids, not amid fertile
plains, but sterile sands. On a like site has Bonaparte constructed the
monument of his renown.

LXXXIII.—CHARACTER OF FRANKLIN.

BROUGHAM.


1. One of the most remarkable men certainly of our times as a politician,
or of any age as a philosopher, was Franklin; who also stands alone
in combining together these two characters, the greatest that man can
sustain, and in this, that, having borne the first part in enlarging
science by one of the greatest discoveries ever made, he bore the second
part in founding one of the greatest empires in the world.

2. In this truly great man every thing seems to concur that goes toward
the constitution of exalted merit. First, he was the architect of his
own fortune. Born in the humblest station, he raised himself by his
talents and industry, first to the place in society which may be attained
with the help only of ordinary abilities, great application, and good
luck; but next, to the loftier heights which a daring and happy genius
alone can scale; and the printers’ boy who at one period of his life
had no covering to shelter his head from the dews of night, rent in
twain the proud dominion of England, and lived to be the ambassador of a
commonwealth which he had formed, at the court of the haughty monarchs of
France, who had been his allies.

3. Then he had been tried by prosperity as well as by adverse fortune,
and had passed unhurt through the perils of both. No ordinary apprentice,
no commonplace journeyman, ever laid the foundation of his independence
in habits of industry and temperance more deep than he did, whose genius
was afterwards to rank him with the Galileos and Newtons of the old
world. No patrician born to shine in courts, or assist at the councils of
monarchs, ever bore his honors in a lofty station more easily, or was
less spoiled by the enjoyment of them, than this common workman did when
negotiating with royal representatives, or caressed by all the beauty and
fashion of the most brilliant court in Europe.

4. Again, he was self-taught in all he knew. His hours of study were
stolen from those of sleep and of meals, or gained by some ingenious
contrivance for reading while the work of his daily calling went on.
Assisted by none of the helps which affluence tenders to the studies of
the rich, he had to supply the place of tutors by redoubled diligence,
and of commentaries by repeated perusal. Nay, the possession of books
was to be obtained by copying what the art which he himself exercised
furnished easily to others.

5. Next, the circumstances under which others succumb he made to yield,
and bent to his own purposes—a successful leader of a revolt that
ended in complete triumph after appearing desperate for years: a great
discoverer in philosophy without the ordinary helps to knowledge; a
writer famed for his chaste style without a classical education; a
skillful negotiator, though never bred to politics; ending as a favorite,
nay, a pattern of fashion when the guest of frivolous courts, the life
which he had begun in garrets and in workshops.

6. Lastly, combinations of faculties, in others deemed impossible,
appeared easy and natural in him. The philosopher, delighting in
speculation, was also eminently a man of action. Ingenious reasoning,
refined and subtle consultation, were in him combined with prompt
resolution and inflexible firmness of purpose. To a lively fancy he
joined a learned and deep reflection; his original and inventive genius
stooped to the convenient alliance of the most ordinary prudence in
every day affairs; the mind that soared above the clouds, and was
conversant with the loftiest human contemplations, disdained not to make
proverbs and feign parables for the guidance of apprenticed youths and
maidens at service; and the hands that sketched a free constitution for
a whole continent, or drew down the lightning from heaven, easily and
cheerfully lent themselves to simplify the apparatus by which truths were
to be illustrated or discoveries pursued.

7. His whole course, both in acting and in speculation, was simple and
plain, ever preferring the easiest and shortest road, nor ever having
recourse to any but the simplest means to compass his ends. His policy
rejected all refinements, and aimed at accomplishing its purposes by
the most rational and obvious expedients. His language was unadorned,
and used as the medium of communicating his thoughts, not of raising
admiration; but it was pure, expressive, racy. His manner of reasoning
was manly and cogent, the address of a rational being to others of the
same order; and so concise, that preferring decision to discussion,
he never exceeded a quarter of an hour in any public address. His
correspondence on business, whether private or on state affairs, is a
model of clearness and compendious shortness; nor can any state papers
surpass in dignity and impressiveness those of which he is believed to
have been the author in the earlier part of the American revolutionary
war.

8. His mode of philosophizing was the purest application of the inductive
principle, so eminently adapted to his nature, and so clearly dictated
by common sense, that we can have little doubt that it would have been
suggested by Franklin, if it had not been unfolded by Bacon, though it
is clear that in this case it would have been expounded in far more
simple terms. But of all this great man’s scientific excellencies,
the most remarkable is the smallness, the simplicity, the apparent
inadequacy of the means which he employed in his experimental researches.
His discoveries were made with hardly any apparatus at all; and if,
at any time, he had been led to employ instruments of a less ordinary
description, he never rested satisfied until he had, as it were,
afterward translated the process, by resolving the problem with such
simple machinery, that you might say he had done it wholly unaided
by apparatus. The experiments by which the identity of lightning and
electricity was demonstrated were made with a sheet of brown paper, a
bit of twine, a silk thread, and an iron key. Upon the integrity of this
great man, whether in public or in private life, there rests no stain.
Strictly honest, and even scrupulously punctual in all his dealings, he
preserved in the highest fortune that regularity which he had practiced,
as well as inculcated, in the lowest.

9. In domestic life he was faultless, and in the intercourse of society,
delightful. There was a constant good humor and a playful wit, easy and
of high relish, without any ambition to shine, the natural fruit of his
lively fancy, his solid, natural good-sense, and his cheerful temper,
that gave his conversation an unspeakable charm, and alike suited every
circle, from the humblest to the most elevated.




LXXXIV.—THE LAST MINSTREL.

SCOTT.

  Sir Walter Scott was born in Edinburgh, August 15, 1771, died
  September 21, 1832. He was distinguished as a poet, and unrivaled
  as a novelist.


  1. The way was long, the wind was cold,
    The Minstrel was infirm and old;
    His withered cheek, and tresses gray,
    Seemed to have known a better day:
    The harp, his sole remaining joy,
    Was carried by an orphan boy;
    The last of all the Bards was he,
    Who sung of Border chivalry.

  2. For well a day! their date was fled,
    His tuneful brethren all were dead;
    And he neglected and oppressed,
    Wished to be with them and at rest.
    No more on prancing palfrey borne,
    He caroled, light as lark at morn;
    No longer courted and caressed,
    High-placed in hall, a welcome guest,
    He poured to lord and lady gay
    The unpremeditated lay.

  3. Old times were changed, old manners gone,
    A stranger filled the Stuart throne,
    The bigots of the Iron time
    Had called the harmless art a crime.
    A wandering Harper, scorned and poor,
    He begged his bread from door to door,
    And tuned, to please a peasants ear,
    The harp a king had loved to hear.

  4. He passed where Newark’s stately tower
    Looks out from Yarrow’s birchen bower;
    The Minstrel gazed with wistful eye,
    No humbler resting-place was nigh;
    With hesitating step, at last,
    The embattled portal arch he passed,
    Whose pond’rous grate and massy bar
    Had oft rolled back the tide of war,
    But never closed the iron door
    Against the desolate and poor.

  5. The Duchess marked his weary pace,
    His timid mien, and reverend face,
    And bade her page the menials tell,
    That they should tend the old man well:
    For she had known adversity,
    Though born in such a high degree;
    In pride of power and beauty’s bloom,
    Had wept o’er Monmouth’s bloody tomb!




LXXXV.—THE MINSTREL BOY.

THOMAS MOORE.


  1. The minstrel boy to the war is gone;
      In the ranks of Death you’ll find him,
    His father’s sword he has girded on,
      And his wild harp slung behind him.
    “Land of song,” said the warrior-bard,
      “Though all the world betrays thee,
    One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard,
      One faithful harp shall praise thee.”

  2. The minstrel fell: but the foeman’s chain
      Could not bring his proud soul under.
    The harp he loved ne’er spoke again,
      For he tore its chords asunder,
    And said, “No chains shall sully thee,
      Thou soul of love and bravery;
    Thy songs were made for the pure and free;
      They never shall sound in slav’ry.”




LXXXVI.—ARMY HYMN.

O. W. HOLMES.


  1. O Lord of Hosts! Almighty King!
    Behold the sacrifice we bring!
    To every arm thy strength impart,
    Thy Spirit shed through every heart.

  2. Wake in our breasts the living fires,
    The holy faith, that warmed our sires;
    Thy hand hath made our nation free;
    To die for her is serving Thee.

  3. Be thou a pillared flame to show
    The midnight snare, the silent foe;
    And when the battle thunders loud,
    Still guide us in its moving cloud.

  4. God of all Nations! Sov’reign Lord!
    In thy dread name we draw the sword;
    We lift the starry flag on high,
    That fills with light our stormy sky.

  5. From treason’s rent, from murder’s stain,
    Guard thou its folds till Peace shall reign;
    Till fort and field, till shore and sea,
    Join our loud anthem,—Praise to Thee!




LXXXVII.—THE ROMAN PONTIFFS.

ARCHBISHOP SPALDING.

  M. J. Spalding, D. D. Archbishop of Baltimore, is a native of
  Kentucky. He is a man of great learning and ability, and of
  untiring industry. He is the author of a very valuable “History
  of the Protestant Reformation,” and of several volumes of Essays
  and Lectures. The following is from his brilliant Introduction to
  the “History of the Church,” by Darras.


1. Take them all in all, the two hundred and fifty Popes and more, who
have successively occupied the Chair of Peter, constitute the most
respectable and venerable body of men whose deeds are recorded on the
pages of history. Nearly all of them were highly respectable men,
learned, enlightened, and pious, far beyond their age; very many of them
were venerable for their personal sanctity. Seventy-nine of them—nearly
a third of the entire number—were so remarkable for their holiness of
character as to merit being inscribed on the Calendar of Saints; and this
number includes thirty-three who willingly laid down their lives for
Christ and His Church.

2. A very large proportion of the others were men of blameless life, and
of indefatigable[585] zeal for the propagation[586] of the faith, while
not a few of them were possessed of great learning and capacity. Such,
for instance, were Innocent III., Innocent IV., Boniface VIII., and
Benedict XIV.,—not to name a host of others in the earlier ages of the
Church.

3. In this connection, it is a remarkable fact, and one which shows how
effectually Christ has watched over His Church, in the person of His
Vicars on earth; that during the last three centuries—since the so-called
Reformation—not a single unworthy or immoral Pope has occupied the
venerable Chair of Peter. While wickedness has abounded[587], and the
very foundations of the faith have been boldly undermined by wicked men
“lying in wait to deceive,” God has taken care of His own, and has spared
scandals in the high places of His Church.

4. The Reformation, has, perhaps, been instrumental in involuntarily and
indirectly rendering this signal service to the cause of the Church,
which it so unblushingly maligned. By removing from the pale of Catholic
Christendom the most turbulent[588] and unrestrained of its members, it
has contributed to purify the atmosphere breathed by the great body of
Christians, who remained faithful; while by its bitter opposition, it has
quickened their zeal and nourished their vigilance. Thus God’s providence
hath drawn good out of evil.

5. Compare the Popes with the sovereigns who have contemporaneously[589]
filled the various thrones of Europe and the world; and mark the
difference, or rather the contrast. While among the latter it is
very difficult to discover even one just man, in a long line of
incumbents;[590] in the former, it is almost as difficult to find one
who is wicked. Among the latter, personal morality, self-restraint, and
purity are the exception; among the former, they are the rule. Among the
latter, a ruler now and then appears clad with the virtues which mark the
saint, as if to show that sanctity is compatible with every condition in
life; among the former so many blameless and saintly men appear, that
we cease to wonder, and yield to no surprise on discovering a new Pope
who is true to the traditions[591] of his order. When we find a solitary
flower in the bleak and dreary desert, we are startled into unbounded
admiration; when we behold whole clusters of them in a flower-garden,
we look with calm pleasure on the beautiful spectacle, but take it as a
matter of course, and are not at all astonished.

LXXXVIII.—LABOR AND GENIUS

SYDNEY SMITH.

  Sydney Smith was born in 1791, and died in 1845. His
  miscellaneous writings, comprising essays, reviews, and
  occasional pieces, are characterized by a happy combination of
  strong sense and brilliant wit.


1. The prevailing idea with young people has been, the
incompatibility[592] of labor and genius; and, therefore, from the fear
of being thought dull, they have thought it necessary to remain ignorant.
I have seen, at school and at college, a great many young men completely
destroyed by having been so unfortunate as to produce an excellent copy
of verses. Their genius being now established, all that remained for them
to do, was to act up to the dignity of the character; and as this dignity
consisted in reading nothing new, in forgetting what they had already
read, and in pretending to be acquainted with all subjects by a sort of
off-hand exertion of talents, they soon collapsed[593] into the most
frivolous and insignificant of men.

2. It would be an extremely profitable thing to draw up a short
and well-authenticated account of the habits of study of the most
celebrated writers with whose style of literary industry we happen to
be most acquainted. It would go very far to destroy the absurd and
pernicious[594] association of genius and idleness, by showing that
the greatest poets, orators, statesmen, and historians—men of the most
brilliant and imposing talents—have actually labored as hard as the
makers of dictionaries and the arrangers of indexes; and that the most
obvious reason why they have been superior to other men is, that they
have taken more pains than other men.

3. Gibbon was in his study every morning, winter and summer, at six
o’clock: Burke was the most laborious and indefatigable[595] of human
beings: Leibnitz[596] was never out of his library: Pascal killed himself
by study: Cicero narrowly escaped death from the same cause: Milton was
at his books with as much regularity as a merchant or an attorney; he had
mastered all the knowledge of his time: so had Homer. Raphael lived but
thirty-seven years; and in that short space carried the art of painting
so far beyond what it had before reached, that he appears to stand alone
as a model to his successors.

4. There are instances to the contrary; but, generally speaking, the life
of all truly great men has been a life of intense and incessant[597]
labor. They have commonly passed the first half of life in the gross
darkness of indigent humility—overlooked, mistaken, contemned by weaker
men,—thinking while others slept, reading while others rioted, feeling
something within them that told them they should not always be kept down
among the dregs of the world; and then, when their time has come, and
some little accident has given them their first occasion, they have burst
out into the light and glory of public life, rich with the spoils of
time, and mighty in all the labors and struggles of the mind.

5. Then do the multitude cry out, “A miracle of genius!” Yes, he is a
miracle of genius, because he is a miracle of labor; because, instead
of trusting to the resources of his own single mind, he has ransacked
a thousand minds; because he makes use of the accumulation of ages,
and takes, as his point of departure, the very last line and boundary
to which science has advanced; because it has ever been the object
of his life to assist every intellectual gift of nature, however
munificent,[598] and however splendid, with every resource that art could
suggest, and every attention diligence could bestow.

6. But, while I am descanting[599] upon the conduct of the understanding,
and the best mode of acquiring knowledge, some men may be disposed to
ask, “Why conduct my understanding with such endless care? and what is
the use of so much knowledge?” What is the use of so much knowledge? What
is the use of so much life? What are we to do with the seventy years of
existence allotted to us? and how are we to live them out to the last?

7. I solemnly declare that, but for the love of knowledge, I should
consider the life of the meanest hedger and ditcher as preferable to that
of the greatest and richest man in existence; for the fire of our minds
is like the fire which the Persians burn on the mountains: it flames
night and day, and is immortal, and not to be quenched! Upon something it
must act and feed—upon the pure spirit of knowledge, or upon the foul
dregs of polluting passions.

8. Therefore, when I say, in conducting your understanding, love
knowledge with a great love, with a vehement love, with a love
coeval[600] with life, what do I say but love innocence, love virtue,
love purity of conduct, love that which, if you are rich and great,
will vindicate the blind fortune which has made you so, and make men
call it justice; love that which, if you are poor, will render your
poverty respectable, and make the proudest feel it unjust to laugh at
the meanness of your fortunes; love that which will comfort you, adorn
you and never quit you,—which will open to you the kingdom of thought,
and all the boundless regions of conceptions, as an asylum against the
cruelty, the injustice, and the pain that may be your lot in the outer
world,—that which will make your motives habitually great and honorable,
and light up in an instant a thousand noble disdains at the very thought
of meanness and of fraud.

9. Therefore, if any young man have embarked his life in pursuit of
knowledge, let him go on without doubting or fearing the event; let him
not be intimidated by the cheerless beginnings of knowledge, by the
darkness from which she springs, by the difficulties which hover around
her, by the wretched habitations in which she dwells, by the want and
sorrow which sometimes journey in her train; but let him ever follow her
as the Angel that guards him, and as the Genius of his life. She will
bring him out at last into the light of day, and exhibit him to the world
comprehensive in acquirements, fertile in resources, rich in imagination,
strong in reasoning, prudent and powerful above his fellows in all the
relations and in all the offices of his life.

LXXXIX.—THE DYING GIRL.

WILLIAMS.


  1. From a Munster vale they brought her,
      From the pure and balmy air,
    An Ormond peasants daughter,
      With blue eyes and golden hair.
    They brought her to the city,
      And she faded slowly there;
    Consumption has no pity
      For blue eyes and golden hair.

  2. When I saw her first reclining,
      Her lips were moved in prayer,
    And the setting sun was shining
      On her loosened golden hair.
    When our kindly glances met her,
      Deadly brilliant was her eye;
    And she said that she was better
      While we knew that she must die.

  3. She speaks of Munster valleys,
      The patron,[601] dance, and fair.
    And her thin hand feebly dallies
      With her scattered golden hair.
    When silently we listened
      To her breath, with quiet care,
    Her eyes with wonder glistened,
      And she asked us what was there.

  4. The poor thing smiled to ask it,
      And her pretty mouth laid bare,
    Like gems within a casket
      A string of pearlets rare.
    We said that we were trying
      By the gushing of her blood,
    And the time she took in sighing,
      To know if she were good.

  5. Well, she smiled and chatted gayly,
      Though we saw, in mute despair,
    The hectic brighter daily,
      And the death-dew on her hair.
    And oft her wasted fingers,
      Beating time upon the bed,
    O’er some old tune she lingers,
      And she bows her golden head.

  6. At length the harp is broken,
      And the spirit in its strings,
    As the last decree is spoken,
      To its source, exulting, springs.
    Descending swiftly from the skies,
      Her guardian angel came,
    He struck God’s lightning from her eyes,
      And bore Him back the flame.

  7. Before the sun had risen
      Through the lark-loved morning air,
    Her young soul left its prison,
      Undefiled by sin or care.
    I stood beside the couch in tears,
      Where, pale and calm, she slept,
    And though I’ve gazed on death for years,
      I blush not that I wept.
    I checked with effort pity’s sighs,
      And left the matron there,
    To close the curtain of her eyes,
      And bind her golden hair.

XC.—THE ANGELUS BELL.

CAMPION.


  1. The large moon of autumn,
      The guardian of night,
    Had closed her pale lamp
      In the firmaments height;
    From the Black Abbey’s towers
      The wild doves careered,
    As the bright dawn of morn
      Awaking appeared;
    And the old marble city,
      From campanile gray,
    Proclaimed to the burghers
      All Noreward—“’twas day!”
      Then the long, mellow knell
        Of the Angelus Bell,
      Seemed psalming and singing
        O’er blessed crypt and cell,
      Where the Black Monks were wont
        In the old times to dwell.

  2. ’Twas noon, at the market-cross,
      In the quaint town,
    And the burgher so comely,
      The tall peasant brown,
    And the gaunt man-at-arms,
      And mild maiden meek,
    With the peach-blush of beauty
      And peace on her cheek,
    Were crowding together
      In hundreds around,
    While the tall cross stood stately
      ’Mid tumult and sound.
        Then the long, mellow knell
          Of the Angelus Bell
        Upon the dense crowd
          In the market-place fell;
        And the burgher knelt down,
          And the peasant as well,
        And the gaunt soldier rude,
          At the peal of the bell,
        While the pure maiden voice
          Joined the long, mellow knell.

  3. ’Twas night o’er the abbey,
      The moon rose again
    O’er the grand domes of pleasure
      And poor haunts of pain;
    And the wild dove was nestled
      Again in the cleft
    Of the old belfry tower
      That early he left;
    And the pale monks were sitting
      Alone and alone,
    With lamps still unlighted,
      And penitent moan;
        When the Angelus Bell,
          With its long, mellow knell,
        Broke up their lone reveries
          Like a blest spell;
        And down on the cold earth
          The holy men fell,
        The grand prayer to chant
          And their long beads to tell;
        While sang with its psalm-voice
          The Angelus Bell.




XCI.—A CURTAIN LECTURE OF MRS. CAUDLE.

JERROLD.

  Douglas William Jerrold was born in London in 1803, and died in
  1857. He was first a midshipman in the navy, then a printer, and
  lastly, a man of letters by profession. His “Caudle Lectures”
  were published in the London Punch, and extensively read in
  England and America.


1. Bah! that’s the third umbrella gone since Christmas. What were you
to do? Why, let him go home in the rain, to be sure. I’m very certain
there was nothing about him that could spoil. Take cold, indeed! He
doesn’t look like one of the sort to take cold. Besides, he’d have better
taken cold than taken our umbrella. Do you hear the rain, Mr. Caudle? I
say, do you hear the rain? And, as I’m alive, if it isn’t St. Swithin’s
day![602] Do you hear it against the window?

2. Nonsense: you don’t impose upon me; you can’t be asleep with such a
shower as that! Do you hear it, I say? O, you _do_ hear it! Well, that’s
a pretty flood, I think, to last for six weeks; and no stirring all the
time out of the house. Pooh! don’t think me a fool, Mr. Caudle; don’t
insult me! _he_ return the umbrella! Any body would think you were born
yesterday. As if any body ever did return an umbrella!

3. There: do you hear it? Worse and worse. Cats and dogs, and for six
weeks: always six weeks; and no umbrella! I should like to know how the
children are to go to school to-morrow. They shan’t go through such
weather, I am determined. No; they shall stop at home, and never learn
any thing, the blessed creatures! sooner than go and get wet! And when
they grow up, I wonder who they’ll have to thank for knowing nothing;
who, indeed, but their father! People who can’t feel for their own
children ought never to be fathers.

4. But I know why you lent the umbrella: O, yes, I know very well. I was
going out to tea at dear mother’s to-morrow: you knew that, and you did
it on purpose. Don’t tell me; you hate to have me go there, and take
every mean advantage to hinder me. But don’t you think it, Mr. Caudle;
no, sir: if it comes down in buckets’ full, I’ll go all the more.

5. No; and I won’t have a cab![603] Where do you think the money’s to
come from? A cab indeed!—Cost me sixteen-pence, at least: sixteen-pence!
two-and-eight-pence; for there’s back again. Cabs, indeed! I should like
to know who’s to pay for ’em; for I’m sure you can’t, if you go on as
you do, throwing away your property, and beggaring your children, buying
umbrellas.

6. Do you hear the rain, Mr. Caudle? I say, do you hear it? But I don’t
care; I’ll go to mother’s to-morrow—I will; and what’s more, I’ll walk
every step of the way; and you know that will give me my death. Don’t
call me a foolish woman; it’s you that’s the foolish man. You know I
can’t wear clogs[604]; and with no umbrella, the wet’s sure to give me a
cold—it always does. But what do you care for that? Nothing at all. I may
be laid up for all you care, as I dare say I shall; and a pretty doctor’s
bill there’ll be. I hope there will. It will teach you to lend your
umbrellas again. I shouldn’t wonder if I caught my death. Yes, and that’s
what you lent the umbrella for. Of course.

7. Nice clothes I get, too, traipsing[605] through weather like this! My
gown and bonnet will be spoiled quite. I needn’t wear ’em then. Indeed,
Mr. Caudle, I _shall_ wear ’em. No, sir; I am not going out a dowdy to
please you or any body else. Gracious knows! it isn’t often that I step
over the threshold; indeed, I might as well be a slave at once: better, I
should say; but when I do go out, Mr. Caudle, I choose to go as a lady.
O, that rain! if it isn’t enough to break in the windows.

8. Ugh! I look forward with dread to to-morrow! How I am to go to
mother’s, I am sure I can’t tell, but if I die, I’ll do it.—No, sir, I
won’t borrow an umbrella: no; and you shan’t _buy_ one. (_With great
emphasis_.) Mr. Caudle, if you bring home another umbrella, I’ll throw it
into the street.

9. Ha! and it was only last week I had a new nozzle put to that umbrella.
I’m sure if I’d have known as much as I do now, it might have gone
without one. Paying for new nozzles for other people to laugh at you! O,
it’s all very well for you; you can go to sleep. You’ve no thought of
your poor patient wife, and your own dear children: you think of nothing
but lending umbrellas!

10. Men, indeed! Call themselves lords of creation! pretty lords, when
they can’t even take care of an umbrella!

11. I know that walk to-morrow will be the death of me, but that’s what
you want: then you may go to your club, and do as you like; and then
nicely my poor dear children will be used; but then, sir, then you’ll be
happy. O, don’t tell me! I know you will! else you’d never have lent the
umbrella!

12. The children, dear things! they’ll be sopping wet; for they shan’t
stay at home; they shan’t lose their learning; it’s ill their father will
leave them, I’m sure.—But they _shall_ go to school. Don’t tell me they
needn’t: you are so aggravating[606], Caudle, you’d spoil the temper of
an angel; they _shall_ go to school! mark that: and if they get their
deaths of cold, it’s not my fault; I didn’t lend the umbrella.

13. “Here,” says Caudle, in his manuscript, “I fell asleep, and dreamed
that the sky was turned into green calico, with whalebone ribs: that, in
fact, the whole world revolved under a tremendous umbrella!”

XCII.—THE SONG OF THE SHIRT.

HOOD.

  Thomas Hood was born in London in 1798, and died in 1845. His
  life was one of severe toil and much suffering, always sustained,
  however, with manly resolution and a cheerful spirit. He wrote
  much, both in prose and verse. He was a man of peculiar and
  original genius, which manifested itself with equal power and
  ease in humor and pathos.

  The following remarkable piece of poetry appeared in the London
  Punch only a short time before the death of the lamented author.
  It was written at a time when the attention of benevolent
  persons in London had been awakened to the inadequate wages
  paid to poor needlewomen, and their consequent distress; and
  from the seasonableness of its appearance, as well as its high
  literary merit, it produced a great effect. It is valuable,
  as an expression of that deep and impassioned sympathy with
  suffering, which was a leading trait in Hood’s nature, and forms
  an attractive element in his writings.

    And still, with a voice of dolorous[607] pitch,
      She sang the “Song of the Shirt!”

  2. Work—work—work!
      While the cock is crowing aloof![608]
    And work—work—work!
      Till the stars shine through the roof!
    It’s O, to be a slave

      That phantom of grisly bone?
    I hardly fear his terrible shape,

      It seems so like my own,
      Because of the fast I keep:
    O God! that bread should be so dear,
      And flesh and blood so cheap!

      As well as the weary hand!

  8. “Work—work—work!

XCIII.—BERNARDO DEL CARPIO.

MRS. HEMANS.

  The celebrated Spanish champion, Bernardo del Carpio, having
  made many ineffectual efforts to procure the release of his
  father, the Count Saldana, who had been imprisoned by King
  Alfonso of Asturias, at last took up arms in despair. The war
  which he maintained proved so destructive that the men of the
  land gathered round the king, and united in demanding Saldana’s
  liberty. Alfonso, accordingly, offered Bernardo immediate
  possession of his father’s person in exchange for his castle of
  Carpio. Bernardo, without hesitation, gave up his stronghold,
  with all his captives, and being assured that his father was
  then on his way from prison, rode forth with the king to meet
  him. “And when he saw his father approaching, he exclaimed,”
  says the ancient chronicle, “O God! is the Count of Saldana
  indeed coming?” “Look where he is,” replied the cruel king;
  “and now go and greet him whom you have so long desired to see.”
  The remainder of the story will be found related in the ballad.
  The chronicles and romances leave us nearly in the dark as to
  Bernardo’s history after this event.


  1. The warrior bowed his crested head, and tamed his heart of fire.
    And sued the haughty king to free his long imprisoned sire:
    “I bring thee here my fortress keys, I bring my captive train;
    I pledge my faith, my liege:[611] my lord, O, break my father’s chain!”

  2. “Rise, rise! even now thy father comes, a ransomed[612] man this day;
    Mount thy good horse, and thou and I will meet him on his way.”
    Then lightly rose that loyal son, and bounded on his steed,
    And urged, as if with lance in rest, the charger’s[613] foamy speed.

  3. And, lo! from far, as on they pressed, there came a glittering band,
    With one that ’midst them stately rode, as a leader in the land.
    “Now haste, Bernardo, haste! for there, in very truth, is he,
    The father, whom thy faithful heart hath yearned[614] so long to see.”

  4. His dark eye flashed, his proud breast heaved, his cheeks’ hue came
        and went;
    He reached that gray-haired chieftain’s side, and, there dismounting,
        bent;
    A lowly knee to earth he bent, his father’s hand he took—
    What was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit shook?

  5. That hand was cold! a frozen thing!—it dropped from his like lead:
    He looked up to the face above—the face was of the dead!
    A plume waved o’er the noble brow—the brow was fixed and white!
    He met, at length, his father’s eyes—but in them was no sight!

  6. Up from the ground he sprang, and gazed; but who could paint that
        gaze!
    They hushed their very hearts, that saw its horror and amaze:
    They might have chained him, as before that stony form he stood;
    For the power was stricken from his arm, and from his lip the blood.

  7. “Father!” at length he murmured low, and wept like childhood then—
    Talk not of grief till thou hast seen the tears of warlike men!—
    He thought on all his glorious hopes, on all his young renown:
    Then flung his falchion from his side, and in the dust sat down;

  8. And covering with his steel-gloved hands his darkly mournful brow,
    “No more, there is no more,” he said, “to lift the sword for now:
    My king is false! my hope betrayed! my father—O, the worth,
    The glory, and the loveliness are passed away from earth!”

  9. Then from the ground he sprang once more, and seized the monarchs
        rein,
    Amidst the pale and wildered looks of all the courtier train;
    And with a fierce, o’ermastering grasp, the rearing war-horse led,
    And sternly set them face to face—the king before the dead!

  10. “Came I not forth, upon thy pledge, my father’s hand to kiss?
    Be still, and gaze thou on, false king! and tell me, what is this?
    The voice, the glance, the heart I sought—give answer, where are they?
    If thou wouldst clear thy perjured[615] soul, send life through this
        cold clay!

  11. “Into these glassy eyes put light—be still! keep down thine ire;
    Bid these white lips a blessing speak—this earth is not my sire!
    Give me back him for whom I strove, for whom my blood was shed—
    Thou canst not?—and a king!—his dust be mountains on thy head!”

  12. He loosed the steed—his slack hand fell;—upon the silent face
    He cast one long, deep, troubled look, then turned from that sad place;
    His hope was crushed, his after-fate untold in martial strain;
    His banner led the spears no more amidst the hills of Spain!

XCIV.—GOD GAVE TO HIS CHURCH CHARITY.

LACORDAIRE.

  Father Lacordaire was born in France in 1802, and died in 1861.
  Of all the great modern French preachers, he was the ablest and
  most brilliant. His “Conferences” at Notre Dame, Paris, attracted
  immense crowds of the most distinguished people of the city. They
  have been translated into English, and published in New York in
  three octave volumes.


1. Society is impossible if it be not founded upon respect for authority
by the people, and for the people by authority. Well, then, the Catholic
Church carries the respect of the people for authority to its highest
degree; she changes the master into a father, so that if the father errs,
the children, like those of the patriarch, cover his faults with the
mantle of their respect. At the same time she instills into the hearts of
sovereigns that respect so delicate, so precious, in the eyes of their
people. In their palaces, and in the midst of their pomp, she causes them
to practice that saying of the Gospel, “He who would be greatest among
you let him be your servant.”

2. The persuasive force which resulted from these rational advantages was
immense. Whether men examined opinions, history, morality, or society,
the Church was without parallel.

3. They were able to deprive her of everything, her patrimony, the
help of the civil authority, the liberty common to all; they could
cast her ministers into prisons, torture them on scaffolds; but men do
not imprison reason, they do not burn accomplished facts, they do not
dishonor virtue, they do not assassinate logic.

4. We are strong then, gentlemen, first by the spirit of God which speaks
in us, but also in the human mind which, when it comes coolly to examine
our history, our dogmas, our morality, is obliged to agree that nothing
is more firmly established.

5. Nevertheless, this was not enough. History only addresses itself to
those who have studied it; ideas enlighten only those who can compare
them, civilization is only appreciable to civilized men.

6. The Church needed a yet more human, that is to say, a more general
source of persuasion. God gave to his Church charity. There was no heart
into which the Church could not penetrate by charity; for misfortune
is the monarch of this lower world, and sooner or later every heart is
touched by his scepter. Men may resist grace and reason, but who shall
resist charity? Why hate those who do good? why kill those who give their
life? Henceforth the Church might advance with confidence to subdue the
universe, for there are tears everywhere in the world, and they are so
natural to us that, even if there were no cause for them, they would flow
without cause, the simple charm of that indefinable sadness of which our
soul is the deep and mysterious well.

7. Metaphysics[616] and history are the pillars of truth; but these
pillars are hidden in the foundations of the temple, they are only sought
for by the light of flambeaux[617] and by distinguished men.

8. A humble priest, a curé of a country village, never enters with the
sciences into the cottage of the poor. He goes there with charity. He
finds there a heart suffering, and consequently open: and the poor man
seeing the priest coming to him full of respect for his misery, and of
feeling for his trouble, easily recognizes truth in the garb of love.

XCV.—UNION AND LIBERTY.

O. W. HOLMES.


  1. Flag of the heroes who left us their glory,
      Borne through our battle-field’s thunder and flame,
    Blazoned in song and illumined in story,
      Wave o’er us all who inherit their fame!
          Up with our banner bright,
          Sprinkled with starry light,
      Spread its fair emblems from mountain to shore;
          While through the sounding sky,
          Loud rings the nation’s cry,—
      Union and Liberty!—one evermore!

  2. Light of our firmament, guide of our nation,
      Pride of her children, and honored afar,
    Let the wide beams of thy full constellation
      Scatter each cloud that would darken a star!

  3. Empire unsceptered! what foe shall assail thee,
      Bearing the standard of Liberty’s van?
    Think not the God of thy fathers shall fail thee,
      Striving with men for the birthright of man!

  4. Yet, if by madness and treachery blighted,
      Dawns the dark hour when the sword thou must draw,
    Then, with the arms of thy millions united,
      Smite the bold traitors to Freedom and Law!

  5. Lord of the universe! shield us and guide us,
      Trusting Thee always, through shadow and sun!
    Thou hast united us, who shall divide us?
      Keep us, oh keep us, the Many in One!
          Up with our banner bright,
          Sprinkled with starry light,
      Spread its fair emblems from mountain to shore;
          While through the sounding sky,
          Loud rings the nation’s cry,—
      Union and Liberty!—one evermore!




XCVI.—GEORGE WASHINGTON.

DWIGHT.


1. To Americans the name of Washington will be ever dear; a savor of
sweet incense, descending to every succeeding generation. The things
which he has done are too great, too interesting, ever to be forgotten.
Every object which we see, every employment in which we are engaged,
every comfort which we enjoy, reminds us daily of his character. The
general peace, liberty, religion, safety, and prosperity, strongly
impress, in every place, what he has done, suffered, and achieved.

2. When a legislature assembles to enact laws; when courts meet to
distribute justice; when congregations gather to worship God; they
naturally and almost necessarily say, “To Washington it is owing,
under God, that we are here.” The farmer pursuing his plow in peace,
the mechanic following the business of his shop in safety, ascribes
the privilege to Washington. The house which, uninvaded, shelters from
the storm, the cheerful fireside surrounded by our little ones, the
table spread in quiet with the bounties of Providence, the bed on which
we repose in undisturbed security, utters, in silent but expressive
language, the memory, and the praise, of Washington.

3. Every ship bears the fruits of his labors on its wings, and exultingly
spreads its streamers to his honor. The student meets him in the still
and peaceful walk; the traveler sees him in all the prosperous and
smiling scenes of his journey; and our whole country, in her thrift,
order, safety and morals, bears, inscribed in sunbeams, throughout her
hills and her plains, the name and the glory of Washington.

4. From a subject so singular, and so edifying, it is not easy to fail
of gaining useful practical instruction. Particularly, the inestimable
benefits which we have derived from the efforts of this great man, cannot
but prompt every ingenuous mind to remember, with unceasing gratitude,
the goodness of God, in bestowing upon us such a blessing; God, who
formed and furnished him for labors so useful, and for a life so glorious.

5. By him are our rulers, at the present and at every future period,
taught how to rule. The same conduct will ever produce substantially
the same effects, the same public well-being, the same glory, the same
veneration. To be wise and good; to forget or restrain the dictates of
passion, and obey those of duty; to seek singly the public welfare,
and lose in it personal gratification; to resist calmly and firmly the
passions, and pursue only the interests, of a nation, is the greatest
secret of ruling well.

6. When these things are exhibited in the strong light of example, and
crowned with success and honor, they are taught in a manner beyond
measure more impressive than can be found in rules and arguments. Here
they are already tried, and proved. Here they are seen surrounded
by all their delightful attendants, and followed by all their happy
consequences. The conviction produced is complete, the impression
supreme. From this great example all rulers may learn wisdom, and our
rulers more than others.

7. The youths, also, of our country, who wish to become great, useful
and honorable, will here find the best directions, and the most powerful
incitements. To be great, useful, and honorable, they must resemble him.
The very actions which he performed, they may indeed not be called to
perform; the sufferings which he underwent, they may not be obliged to
undergo; but the attributes which he possessed and displayed, must, in a
good degree, be possessed and displayed by them also.

8. Let them particularly remember, that greatness is not the result
of mere chance or genius; that it is not the fact of brilliancy, nor
the desperate sally of ambition; that it is, on the contrary, the
combined result of strong mental endowments, vigorous cultivation,
honorable design, and wise direction. It is not the glare of the meteor;
glittering, dazzling, consuming, and vanishing; but the steady and
exalted splendor of the sun; a splendor which, while it shines with
prëeminent brightness, warms also, enlivens, adorns, improves, and
perfects the objects on which it shines: glorious indeed by its lustre,
but still more glorious in the useful effects produced by its power.

9. Of this great truth the transcendent example before us is a most
dignified exhibition. Let them imitate, therefore, the incessant
attention, the exact observation, the unwearied industry, the scrupulous
regard to advice, the slowness of decision, the cautious prudence, the
nice punctuality, the strict propriety, the independence of thought and
feeling, the unwavering firmness, the unbiassed impartiality, the steady
moderation, the exact justice, the unveering[618] truth, the universal
humanity, and the high veneration for religion and for God, always
manifested by this great man. Thus will future Washingtons arise to bless
our happy country.

[618] UN-VEERˊ-ING, unchanging, fixed.




XCVII.—CONDUCT OF LA FAYETTE IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.

J. Q. ADAMS.


1. The war of American Independence is closed. The people of the North
American confederation are in union, sovereign and independent. La
Fayette, at twenty-five years of age, had lived the life of a patriarch,
and illustrated the career of a hero. Had his days upon earth been then
numbered, and had he then slept with his fathers, illustrious as for
centuries their names had been, his name, to the end of time, would have
transcended them all.

2. Fortunate youth! fortunate beyond even the measure of his companions
in arms with whom he had achieved the glorious consummation of American
Independence. His fame was all his own; not cheaply earned; not ignobly
won. His fellow-soldiers had been the champions and defenders of their
country. They reaped for themselves, for their wives, their children,
their posterity to the latest time, the rewards of their dangers and
their toils. La Fayette had watched, and labored, and fought, and bled,
not for himself, not for his family, not, in the first instance, even for
his country.

3. In the legendary tales of chivalry we read of tournaments at which a
foreign and unknown knight suddenly presents himself, armed in complete
steel, and, with the visor down, enters the ring to contend with the
assembled flowers of knighthood for the prize of honor, to be awarded by
the hand of beauty; bears it in triumph away, and disappears from the
astonished multitude of competitors and spectators of the feats of arms.

4. But where in the rolls of history, where in the fictions of romance,
where, but in the life of La Fayette, has been seen the noble stranger,
flying, with the tribute of his name, his rank, his affluence, his
ease, his domestic bliss, his treasure, his blood, to the relief of a
suffering and distant land, in the hour of her deepest calamity—baring
his bosom to her foes; and not at the transient[619] pageantry[620] of
a tournament,[621] but for a succession of five years sharing all the
vicissitudes[622] of her fortunes; always eager to appear at the post
of danger—tempering the glow of youthful ardor with the cold caution of
a veteran commander; bold and daring in action; prompt in execution;
rapid in pursuit; fertile in expedients; unattainable in retreat; often
exposed, but never surprised, never disconcerted; eluding his enemy, when
within his fancied grasp; bearing upon him with irresistible sway when of
force to cope with him in the conflict of arms? And what is this but the
diary of La Fayette, from the day of his rallying the scattered fugitives
of the Brandywine, insensible of the blood flowing from his wound, to the
storming of the redoubt[623] at Yorktown.

[619] TRANˊ-SIENT, passing, not permanent.

XCVIII.—PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.

H. W. LONGFELLOW.


  1. Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five:
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

  2. He said to his friend: “If the British march
    By land or sea from the town to-night,
    Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
    Of the North-Church tower, as a signal-light,—
    One, if by land, and two, if by sea;
    And I on the opposite shore will be,
    Ready to ride and spread the alarm
    Through every Middlesex village and farm,
    For the country-folk to be up and to arm?”

  3. Then he said good-night, and with muffled oar
    Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,
    Just as the moon rose over the bay,
    Where, swinging wide at her moorings, lay
    The Somerset, British man-of-war:
    A phantom ship, with each mast and spar
    Across the moon like a prison bar,
    And a huge, black hulk, that was magnified
    By its own reflection in the tide.

  4. Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street,
    Wanders and watches with eager ears,
    Till, in the silence around him, he hears
    The muster of men at the barrack door,
    The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
    And the measured tread of the grenadiers
    Marching down to their boats on the shore.

  5. Then he climbed to the tower of the church,
    Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,
    To the belfry chamber overhead,
    And startled the pigeons from their perch
    On the somber rafters, that round him made
    Masses and moving shapes of shade,—
    Up the trembling ladder, steep and tall,
    To the highest window in the wall,
    Where he paused to listen, and look down
    A moment on the roofs of the town,
    And the moonlight flowing over all.

  6. Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead
    In their night encampment on the hill,
    Wrapped in silence so deep and still
    That he could hear, like a sentinel’s tread,
    The watchful night-wind, as it went
    Creeping along from tent to tent,
    And seeming to whisper, “All is well!”
    A moment only he feels the spell
    Of the place and the hour, the secret dread
    Of the lonely belfry and the dead;
    For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
    On a shadowy substance far away,
    Where the river widens to meet the bay,—
    A line of black, that bends and floats
    On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.

  7. Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,
    Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride
    On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
    Now he patted his horse’s side,
    Now gazed on the landscape far and near,
    Then impetuous stamped the earth,
    And turned and tightened the saddle-girth;
    But mostly he watched with eager search
    The belfry tower of the old North Church,
    As it rose above the graves on the hill,
    Lonely and spectral and somber and still.

  8. And lo! as he looks on the belfry’s height,
    A glimmer, and then a gleam, of light!
    He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,
    But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
    A second lamp in the belfry burns!

  9. A hurry of hoofs in a village street,
    A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
    And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
    Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet:
    That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,
    The fate of a nation was riding that night;
    And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,
    Kindled the land into flame with its heat.

  10. It was twelve by the village clock,
    When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
    He heard the crowing of the cock,
    And the barking of the farmers dog,
    And felt the damp of the river fog,
    That rises after the sun goes down.

  11. It was one by the village clock,
    When he galloped into Lexington.
    He saw the gilded weathercock
    Swim in the moonlight as he passed,
    And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,
    Gaze at him with a spectral glare,
    As if they already stood aghast
    At the bloody work they would look upon.

  12. It was two by the village clock,
    When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
    He heard the bleating of the flock,
    And the twitter of birds among the trees,
    And felt the breath of the morning breeze
    Blowing over the meadows brown.
    And one was safe and asleep in his bed
    Who at the bridge would be first to fall,
    Who that day would be lying dead,
    Pierced by a British musket-ball.

  13. You know the rest. In the books you have read
    How the British regulars fired and fled,—
    How the farmers gave them ball for ball,
    From behind each fence and farm-yard wall,
    Chasing the red-coats down the lane,
    Then crossing the fields to emerge again
    Under the trees at the turn of the road,
    And only pausing to fire and load.




XCIX.—SIR THOMAS MOORE.

HENRY GILES.

  Henry Giles, a distinguished author and lecturer, was born in
  Ireland.


1. A just man is always simple. He is a man of direct aims and purposes;
there is no complexity in his motives, and, thence, there is no jarring
or discordancy in his character. He wishes to do right, and in most cases
he does it; he may err, but in most cases it is by mistake of judgment,
and not by perversity of intention. The moment his judgment is enlighted,
his action is corrected. Setting before himself always a clear and worthy
end, he will never pursue it by any concealed or unworthy means.

2. We may carry our remarks, for illustration, both into private and
into public life. Observe such a man in his home, there is a charm about
him, which no artificial grace has ever had the power to bestow; there
is a sweetness, I had almost said, a music, in his manners, which no
sentimental refinement has ever given. His speech, ever fresh from purity
and rectitude of thought, controls all that are within its hearing, with
an unfelt, yet a resistless sway. Faithful to every domestic trust,
as to his religion and his God, he would no more prove recreant to any
loyalty of home, than he would blaspheme the Maker in whom he believes,
or than he would forswear the heaven in which he hopes.

3. Fidelity and truth to those bound by love and nature to his heart, are
to him most sacred principles; they throb in the last recesses of his
moral being, they are embedded in the life of his life; and to violate
them, or even think of violating them, would seem to him as a spiritual
extermination, the suicide of his soul. Nor is such a man unrewarded,
for the goodness he so largely gives is largely paid back to him again;
and though the current of his life is transparent, it is not shallow; on
the contrary, it is deep and strong. The river that fills its channel
glides smoothly along in the power of its course; it is the stream which
scarcely covers the ruggedness of its bed, that is turbulent and noisy.

4. With all this gentleness, there is exceeding force; with all this
meekness, there is imperative command; but the force is the force of
wisdom, and the command is the command of love. And, yet, the authority
which rules so effectually, never gathers an angry or an irritable cloud
over the brow of the ruler; and this sway, which admits of no resistance,
does not oppress one honest impulse of nature, one movement of the soul’s
high freedom, one bound of joy from the heart’s unbidden gladness, in the
spirit of the governed.

5. Take this character into public life. Place him before the people as
the candidate for their legislative suffrages; he is there for no selfish
ambition, and, willing to be most loyal to his country, he will be no
traitor to his conscience. Place him in the legislative assembly to which
these willing suffrages send him, he maintains inviolate the trust given
to him; with a brave eloquence he maintains the rights of the citizens:
with a grave dignity he maintains the privileges of the senator. Place
him in the council of the executive magistrate, and no favor can win him,
and no danger appall; indifferent to office and fearless of power, he
will assert the highest right, and he will stand by it, whatever be the
cost.

6. Place him on the bench of justice, no prejudice can approach him, no
passion can move him. Nothing can ruffle the august placidity of his
soul, except it be the stirrings of a gracious pity. Unmoved he sits,
while all around him heaves; he listens not to popular clamor, he cares
not for the scowl of power; and, while he is guardian, no corruption
shall sully the fountain of justice, and no obstruction shall impede its
stream. Place him in the presence of a tyrant; call upon him for his
opinion, let life or death hang on the result, he will not speak rashly,
but he will not speak falsely.

7. Let the tyrant cajole and fondle, it avails not; let the tyrant rail
and threaten, it is still as vain; let wife entreat, let children hang
upon his neck, let friends beseech, let multitudes implore, he meets
affection with affection; he weeps while others weep; but, fixed as the
rock in the ocean, the tempest may crash about his head, and the waves
strike against his breast, his foundation based unchangeably on the
centre of eternal right, his head majestically erect, gloriously lifted
up to heaven, bends not before the shock, and his breast receives the
tempest only to shiver it.

8. Place him in the dungeon: shut him in from the fair earth and the open
sky; wrench him from the delights of home; let him be loaded with years;
let him be enfeebled by sickness; let him be wearied with confinement;
let life hang by the finest thread that ever held a spirit from its
God,—the unwavering faith of a true man upholds him, and his hope remains
undimmed, and his peace remains unbroken.

9. Call him from the dungeon to his doom, he goes rejoicing to the
scaffold; he looks cheerfully on the ax; he faces death almost with
gayety; he forgives his enemies; he pities his destroyers; he wishes good
to all men; he gives a moment to silent prayer; he meekly lays his head
upon the block;—then, there is the echo of a blow that sends a soul to
heaven. This character is not imaginary; it is real, it is practicable.
The original is Sir Thomas Moore, of England.




C.—THE BATTLE FIELD.

BRYANT.


  1. Once this soft turf, this rivulet’s sands,
      Were trampled by a hurrying crowd,
    And fiery hearts and arméd hands
      Encountered in the battle-cloud.

  2. Ah, never shall the land forget
      How gushed the life-blood of her brave,—
    Gushed, warm with hope and valor yet,
      Upon the soil they fought to save.

  3. Now all is calm, and fresh, and still;
      Alone the chirp of flitting bird,
    And talk of children on the hill,
      And bell of wandering kine,[624] are heard.

  4. No solemn host goes trailing by
      The black-mouthed gun and staggering wain;[625]
    Men start not at the battle-cry;—
      O, be it never heard again!

  5. Soon rested those who fought; but thou,
      Who minglest in the harder strife
    For truths which men receive not now,—
      Thy warfare only ends with life.

  6. A friendless warfare! lingering long
      Through weary day and weary year;
    A wild and many-weaponed throng
      Hang on thy front, and flank, and rear.

  7. Yet nerve thy spirit to the proof,
      And blench not at thy chosen lot!
    The timid good may stand aloof,
      The sage may frown—yet faint thou not!

  8. Nor heed the shaft too surely cast,
      The hissing, stinging bolt of scorn,
    For with thy side shall dwell at last
      The victory of endurance born.

  9. Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again;
      The eternal years of God are hers;
    But Error, wounded, writhes with pain,
      And dies among his worshipers.

      When those who helped thee flee in fear,—
    Die full of hope and manly trust,
      Like those who fell in battle here.

  11. Another hand thy sword shall wield,[626]
      Another hand the standard wave,
    Till from the trumpet’s mouth is pealed[627]
      The blast of triumph o’er thy grave!

CI.—THE RELIGION OF CATHOLICS.

DR. DOYLE.

  Right Reverend James Doyle was born at New Ross, County Wexford,
  Ireland, in 1786; died in 1834. His letters written over the
  signature of J. K. on all the great topics of the day in Ireland,
  are classed among the ablest documents of the kind ever written.


1. It was the creed, my lord, of a Charlemagne and of a St. Louis, of
an Alfred and an Edward, of the monarchs of the feudal times, as well
as of the Emperors of Greece and Rome; it was believed at Venice and at
Genoa, in Lucca and the Helvetic nations in the days of their freedom
and greatness; all the barons of the middle ages, all the free cities
of later times, professed the religion we now profess. You know well my
lord, that the charter of British freedom, and the common law of England,
have their origin and source in Catholic times.

2. Who framed the free constitutions of the Spanish Goths? Who preserved
science and literature, during the long night of the middle ages? Who
imported literature from Constantinople, and opened for her an asylum at
Rome, Florence, Padua, Paris and Oxford? Who polished Europe by art, and
refined her by legislation? Who discovered the New World and opened a
passage to another? Who were the masters of architecture, of painting,
and of music? Who invented the compass, and the art of printing? Who were
the poets, the historians, the jurists, the men of deep research, and
profound literature?

3. Who have exalted human nature, and made man appear again little less
than the angels? Were they not almost exclusively the professors of our
creed? Were they who created and possessed freedom under every shape and
form, unfit for her enjoyment? Were men, deemed even now the lights of
the world and the benefactors of the human race, the deluded victims of
a slavish superstition? But what is there in our creed which renders us
unfit for freedom?

4. Is it the doctrine of passive obedience? No, for the obedience we
yield to authority, is not blind, but reasonable? our religion does not
create despotism; it supports every established constitution which is
not opposed to the laws of nature, unless it be altered by those who are
entitled to change it. In Poland it supported an elective monarch; in
France an hereditary sovereign; in Spain, an absolute or constitutional
king indifferently; in England when the houses of York and Lancaster
contended, it declared that he who was king _de facto_ was entitled to
the obedience of the people.

5. During the reign of the Tudors, there was a faithful adherence of the
Catholics to their prince, under trials the most severe and galling,
because the constitution required it; the same was exhibited by them
to the ungrateful race of Stuart; but since the expulsion of James
(foolishly called an abdication), have they not adopted with the nation
at large, the doctrine of the Revolution: “that the crown is held in
trust for the benefit of the people; and that should the monarch violate
his compact, the subject is freed from the bond of his allegiance?”
Has there been any form of government ever devised by man to which the
religion of Catholics has not been accommodated?

6. Is there any obligation, either to a prince, or to a constitution,
which it does not enforce? What, my lord, is the allegiance of man
divided who gives to Cæsar what belongs to Cæsar, and to God what belongs
to God? Is the allegiance of the priest divided who yields submission
to his bishop and his king?—of the son who obeys his parent and his
prince? And yet these duties are more distinct than those which we owe
our sovereign and spiritual head. Is there any man in society who has not
distinct duties to discharge?

7. May not the same person be the head of a corporation, and an officer
of the king? a justice of the peace, perhaps, and a bankrupt surgeon,
with half his pay? And are the duties thus imposed upon him, incompatible
one with another? If the Pope can define that the Jewish sabbath is
dissolved, and that the Lord’s day is to be sanctified, may not this
be believed without prejudice to the act of settlement, or that for
the limitation of the crown? If the Church decree that on Fridays her
children should abstain from flesh-meat, are they thereby controlled from
obeying the king when he summons them to war?




CII.—A BIRTH-DAY OFFERING.

DR. NEWMAN.

  Dr. John Henry Newman, a distinguished Catholic Ecclesiastic, was
  formerly a minister of the Established Church in England, and
  leader of what has been called the Puseyite movement. He is a man
  of very remarkable ability.


  1. Dear Frank, this morn has ushered in
      The manhood of thy days;
    A boy no more, thou must begin
      To choose thy future ways;
    To brace thy arm, and nerve thy heart,
      For maintenance of a noble part.

  2. And thou a voucher[628] fair hast given,
      Of what thou wilt achieve,
    Ere age has dimmed thy sunlit heaven
      In weary life’s chill eve;
    Should Sovereign Wisdom in its grace
      Vouchsafe to thee so long a race.

  3. My brother, we are linked with chain
      That time shall ne’er destroy;
    Together we have been in pain,
      Together now in joy;
    For duly I to share may claim
      The present brightness of thy name.

  4. My brother, ’tis no recent tie
      Which binds our fates in one,
    E’en from our tender infancy
      The twisted thread was spun;—
    Her deed, who stored in her fond mind
      Our forms, by sacred love enshrined.[629]

  5. In her affection all had share,
      All six, she loved them all;
    Yet on her early-chosen Pair
      Did her full favor fall;
    And we became her dearest theme,
      Her waking thought, her nightly dream.

  6. Ah! brother, shall we e’er forget
      Her love, her care, her zeal?
    We cannot pay the countless debt,
      But we must ever feel;
    For through her earnestness were shed
    Prayer-purchased blessings on our head.

  7. Though in the end of days she stood,
      And pain and weakness came,
    Her force of thought was unsubdued,
      Her fire of love the same;
    And e’en when memory failed its part,
      We still kept lodgment in her heart.

  8. And when her Maker from the thrall[630]
      Of flesh her spirit freed,
    No suffering ’companied the call,
      —In mercy ’twas decreed,—
    One moment here, the next she trod
    The viewless mansion of her God.

  9. Now then at length she is at rest,
      And, after many a woe,
    Rejoices in that Saviour blest,
      Who was her hope below;
    Kept till the day when he shall own
    His saints before His Father’s throne.

  10. So it is left for us to prove
      Her prayers were not in vain;
    And that God’s grace-according love
      Has fallen as gentle rain,
    Which, sent in the due vernal[631] hour,
    Tints the young leaf, perfumes the flower.

  11. Dear Frank, we both are summoned now
      As champions of the Lord;—
    Enrolled am I, and shortly thou
      Must buckle on thy sword;
    A high employ, nor lightly given,
    To serve as messengers of heaven!

  12. Deep in my heart that gift I hide;
      I change it not away,
    For patriot-warrior’s hour of pride,
      Or statesman’s tranquil[632] sway;
    For poet’s fire, or pleader’s skill
    To pierce the soul and tame the will.

  13. O! may we follow undismayed[633]
      Where’er our God shall call!
    And may His Spirit’s present aid
      Uphold us lest we fall!
    Till in the end of days we stand,
    As victors in a deathless land.

CIII.—SPEECH OF LOGAN, CHIEF OF THE MINGOES.

JEFFERSON.


1. I may challenge the whole of the orations of Demosthenes and Cicero,
and, indeed, of any more eminent orators, if Europe, or the world,
has furnished more eminent, to produce a single passage superior to
the speech of Logan, a Mingo chief, delivered to Lord Dunmore, when
governor of Virginia. As a testimony of Indian talents in this line, I
beg leave to introduce it, by first stating the incidents necessary for
understanding it.

2. In the spring of the year 1774, a robbery was committed, by some
Indians, upon certain land adventurers[634] on the Ohio river. The whites
in that quarter, according to their custom, undertook to punish this
outrage in a summary[635] way. Captain Michael Cresap, and one Daniel
Greathouse, leading on these parties, surprised, at different times,
traveling and hunting parties of the Indians, who had their women and
children with them, and murdered many. Among these, were unfortunately
the family of Logan, a chief celebrated in peace and war, and long
distinguished as the friend of the whites.

3. This unworthy return provoked his vengeance. He accordingly
signalized[636] himself in the war which ensued. In the autumn of the
same year a decisive battle was fought at the mouth of the Great Kanhawa,
between the collected forces of the Shawnees, the Mingoes, and the
Delawares, and a detachment[637] of the Virginia militia. The Indians
were defeated, and sued for peace. Logan, however, disdained to be seen
among the suppliants: but, lest the sincerity of a treaty from which so
distinguished a chief absented himself, should be distrusted, he sent by
a messenger, the following speech to be delivered to Lord Dunmore.

4. “I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan’s cabin
hungry, and he gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he
clothed him not. During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan
remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for
the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said ‘Logan is
the friend of the white men.’ I had even thought to live with you, but
for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, last spring in cold blood,
and unprovoked, murdered all the relatives of Logan, not sparing even my
women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any
living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it. I have
killed many. I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice
at the beams of peace: but do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy
of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his
life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.”

CIV.—GOD IS EVERY WHERE.


          1. Oh! show me where is He,
            The high and holy One,
            To whom thou bend’st the knee,
            And pray’st, “Thy will be done!”
            I hear thy song of praise,
            And lo! no _form_ is near:
            Thine _eyes_ I see thee raise,
            But where doth God appear?
  Oh! teach me who _is_ God, and where his glories shine,
  That I may kneel and pray, and call _thy_ Father _mine_.

          2. “Gaze on that arch above:
            The glittering vault admire.
            _Who_ taught these orbs to move?
            _Who_ lit their ceaseless fire?
            _Who_ guides the moon to run
            In silence through the skies?
            _Who_ bids that dawning sun
            In strength and beauty rise?
  There view immensity! behold! my God is there:
  The sun, the moon, the stars, his majesty declare.

          3. “See where the _mountains_ rise;
            Where thundering _torrents_ foam;
            Where, vailed in towering skies,
            The _eagle_ makes his home:
            Where savage nature dwells,
            My God is present too;
            Through all her wildest dells
            His footsteps I pursue:
  _He_ reared those giant cliffs, supplies that dashing stream,
  Provides the daily food which stills the wild bird’s scream.

          4. “Look on that world of _waves_,
            Where finny nations glide;
            Within whose deep, dark caves
            The ocean-monsters hide:
            His power is sovereign there,
            To raise, to quell the storm;
            The depths His bounty share,
            Where sport the scaly swarm;
  Tempests and calms obey the same almighty voice,
  Which rules the earth and skies, and bids far worlds rejoice.

          5. “No human thoughts can soar
            Beyond His boundless might;
            _He_ swells the thunder’s roar,
            _He_ spreads the wings of night.
            Oh! praise His works divine!
            Bow down thy soul in prayer;
            Nor ask for other sign,
            That God is everywhere:
  The viewless spirit, He—immortal, holy, blest—
  Oh! worship Him in faith, and find eternal rest!”




CV.—CHARACTER OF THE IRISH PEASANTRY.

BARRINGTON.

  Sir Jonah Barrington was born in Ireland in 1767, and died in
  1834. He was a member of the Irish Parliament which met in
  Dublin before the act of Union in 1800, and which numbered among
  its members a great many men of distinguished character and
  brilliant talents, such as Grattan, Curran, Plunkett, Flood, and
  others. His “Personal Sketches” are racy, humorous, and full of
  interesting anecdotes.


1. The Irish people have been as little known, as they have been grossly
defamed, to the rest of Europe. The lengths to which English writers
have proceeded in pursuit of this object would surpass all belief, were
not the facts proved by histories written under the immediate eye and
sanction of Irish governments; histories replete with falsehood, which,
combined with the still more mischievous misrepresentations of modern
writers, form altogether a mass of the most cruel calumnies that ever
weighed down the character of a meritorious[638] people.

2. This system, however, was not without its meaning. From the reign
of Elizabeth, the policy of England has been to keep Ireland in a
state of internal division; perfect unanimity among her inhabitants
has been considered as likely to give her a population and a power
incompatible[639] with subjection,[640] and there are not wanting natives
of Ireland, who, impressed with that erroneous idea, zealously plunge
into the same doctrine, as if they would best prove their loyalty to the
king by vilifying their country.

3. The Irish peasantry, who necessarily compose the great body of the
population, combine in their character many of those singular and
repugnant[641] qualities which peculiarly designate the people of
different nations; and this remarkable contrariety of characteristic
traits pervades almost the whole current of their natural dispositions.
Laborious, domestic, accustomed to want in the midst of plenty, they
submit to hardships without repining, and bear the severest privations
with stoic fortitude. The sharpest wit, and the shrewdest subtilty, which
abound in the character of the Irish peasant, generally lie concealed
under the semblance of dullness, or the appearance of simplicity; and
his language, replete with the keenest humor, possesses an idiom of
equivocation,[642] which never fails successfully to evade a direct
answer to an unwelcome question.

4. Inquisitive, artful, and penetrating, the Irish peasant learns
mankind without extensive intercourse, and has an instinctive knowledge
of the world, without mingling in its societies; and never, in any other
instance, did there exist a people who could display so much address
and so much talent in the ordinary transactions of life as the Irish
peasantry.

5. The Irish peasant has, at all periods, been peculiarly distinguished
for unbounded but indiscriminate[643] hospitality, which, though
naturally devoted to the necessities of a friend, is never denied by him
even to the distresses of an enemy.[644] To be in want or misery, is the
best recommendation to his disinterested protection; his food, his bed,
his raiment, are equally the stranger’s and his own; and the deeper the
distress the more welcome is the sufferer to the peasant’s cottage.

6. His attachments to his kindred are of the strongest nature. The social
duties are intimately blended with the natural disposition of an Irish
peasant; though covered with rags, oppressed with poverty, and perhaps
with hunger, the finest specimens of generosity and heroism are to be
found in his unequaled character.

7. An enthusiastic attachment to the place of their nativity is another
striking trait of the Irish character, which neither time nor absence,
prosperity nor adversity, can obliterate or diminish. Wherever an Irish
peasant was born, there he wishes to die; and, however successful
in acquiring wealth or rank in distant places, he returns with fond
affections to renew his intercourse with the friends and companions of
his youth and his obscurity.

8. An innate spirit of insubordination to the laws has been strongly
charged upon the Irish peasantry; but a people to whom the punishment
of crimes appears rather as a sacrifice to revenge than a measure of
prevention, can never have the same deference to the law as those who
are instructed in the principles of justice and taught to recognize its
equality. It has, however, been uniformly admitted by every impartial
writer on the affairs of Ireland, that a spirit of strict justice has
ever characterized the Irish peasant.[645]

9. Convince him by plain and impartial reasoning, that he is wrong; and
he withdraws from the judgment-seat, if not with cheerfulness, at least
with submission: but, to make him respect the laws, he must be satisfied
that they are impartial; and, with that conviction on his mind, the Irish
peasant is as perfectly tractable as the native of any other country in
the world.

10. An attachment to, and a respect for females, is another
characteristic of the Irish peasant. The wife partakes of all her
husband’s vicissitudes; she shares his labor and his miseries, with
constancy and with affection. At all the sports and meetings of the
Irish peasantry, the women are always of the company; they have a great
influence; and, in his smoky cottage, the Irish peasant, surrounded by
his family, seems to forget all his privations. The natural cheerfulness
of his disposition banishes reflection; and he experiences a simple
happiness, which even the highest ranks of society might justly envy.

[638] MERˊ-I-TOˊ-RI-OUS, having merit, deserving well.

[639] IN-COM-PATˊ-I-BLE, inconsistent.

[640] SUB-JECˊ-TION, under control, being subject to.

[641] RE-PUGˊ-NANT, opposite; inconsistent.

[642] E-QUIVˊ-O-CA-TION, ambiguity of speech.

[643] IN-DIS-CRIMˊ-IN-ATE, not making distinction.

[644] It has been remarked that the English and Irish people form their
judgment of strangers very differently:—an Englishman suspects a stranger
to be a rogue, till he finds that he is an honest man; the Irishman
conceives every person to be an honest man till he finds him out to be
a rogue; and this accounts for the very striking difference in their
conduct and hospitality to strangers.

[645] Sir John Davis, attorney-general of Ireland, who, in the reign of
James the First, was employed by the king to establish the English laws
throughout Ireland, and who made himself perfectly acquainted with the
character of the inhabitants, admits that “there were no people under
heaven, who loved equal and impartial justice better than the Irish.”




CVI.—ADVICE TO A YOUNG CRITIC.

POPE.


  1. ’Tis not enough, taste, judgment, learning join;
    In all you speak, let truth and candor shine;
    That not alone what to your sense is due
    All may allow, but seek your friendship too.
    Be silent always, when you doubt your sense,
    And speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence.[646]

  2. Some positive, persisting[647] fops we know,
    Who, if once wrong, will needs be always so:
    But _you_, with pleasure, own your errors past,
    And make each day a critic on the last.
    ’Tis not enough your counsel to be true:
    Blunt truths more mischief than slight errors do;
    Men must be taught, as if you taught them not,
    And things unknown proposed, as things forgot.

  3. Without good breeding truth is disapproved;
    That only makes superior sense beloved.
    Be niggard[648] of advice on no pretense;
    For the worst avarice is that of sense.
    With mean complacence[649] ne’er betray your trust
    Nor be so civil as to prove unjust.
    Fear not the anger of the wise to raise;
    Those best can bear reproof, who merit praise.

  4. But where’s the man who counsel can bestow,
    Still pleased to teach, and yet not proud to know;
    Unbiassed, or by favor, or by spite;
    Not dully prepossessed, nor blindly right;
    Though learned, well-bred; and, though well-bred, sincere;
    Modestly bold, and humanly severe;
    Who to a friend his faults can freely show,
    And gladly praise the merit of a foe?

  5. Blest with a taste exact, yet unconfined;
    A knowledge both of books and human kind;
    Generous converse, a soul exempt from pride,
    And love to praise with reason on his side;
    Careless of censure, nor too fond of fame;
    Still pleased to praise, yet not afraid to blame;
    Averse alike to flatter or offend;
    Not free from faults, nor yet too vain to mend?

[646] DIFˊ-FI-DENCE, want of confidence.

[647] PER-SISTˊ-ING, persevering steadily.

[648] NIGˊ-GARD, meanly; parsimonious.

[649] COM-PLAˊ-CENCE, civility.




CVII.—MARIE ANTOINETTE.

BURKE.

  Edmund Burke was born in Ireland in 1728, and died in 1797. Such
  was the transcendent ability of Burke, that, at a time when
  England was richest in brilliant orators, and great statesmen, he
  rose from his obscure position, as a young and unknown Irishman,
  to be the great central figure in the array of great names which
  shed a lustre over the closing years of the Eighteenth century.
  But to his unrivaled merits as an orator and statesman, can be
  added the still higher praise of being a man of unblemished honor
  and probity.


1. History will record, that on the morning of the 6th of October, 1789,
the King and Queen of France, after a day of confusion, alarm, dismay,
and slaughter, lay down, under the pledged security of public faith, to
indulge nature in a few hours of respite, and troubled, melancholy repose.

2. From this sleep the queen was first startled by the voice of
the sentinel at her door, who cried out to her, to save herself by
flight—that this was the last proof of fidelity he could give—that they
were upon him, and he was dead. Instantly he was cut down. A band of
cruel ruffians and assassins, reeking with blood, rushed into the chamber
of the queen, and pierced with a hundred strokes of bayonets and poniards
the bed from whence this persecuted woman had but just time to fly almost
naked, and, through ways unknown to the murderers, had escaped to seek
refuge at the feet of a king and husband, not secure of his own life for
a moment.

3. This king, to say no more of him, and this queen, and their infant
children (who once would have been the pride and hope of a great and
generous people), were then forced to abandon the sanctuary of the
most splendid palace in the world, which they left swimming in blood,
polluted by massacre, and strewed with scattered limbs and mutilated[650]
carcasses. Thence they were conducted into the capital of their kingdom.
Two had been selected from the unprovoked, unresisted, promiscuous[651]
slaughter, which was made of the gentlemen of birth and family, who
composed the king’s body-guard. These two gentlemen, with all the parade
of an execution of justice, were cruelly and publicly dragged to the
block, and beheaded in the great court of the palace.

4. Their heads were stuck upon spears, and led the procession; while
the royal captives, who followed in the train, were slowly moved along,
amidst the horrid yells, and thrilling screams, and frantic dances, and
infamous contumelies,[652] and all the unutterable abominations of the
furies of hell, in the abused shapes of the vilest of women. After they
had been made to taste, drop by drop, more than the bitterness of death,
in the slow torture of a journey of twelve miles, protracted[653] to six
hours, they were, under a guard, composed of those very soldiers who had
thus conducted them through this famous triumph, lodged in one of the old
palaces of Paris, now converted into a Bastile for kings....

5. It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of France,
then the Dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never lighted on this
orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw
her just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere
she just began to move in,—glittering like the morning star, full of
life, and splendor, and joy. Oh! what a revolution! and what a heart I
must have, to contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall!
Little did I dream, when she added titles of veneration, to those of
enthusiastic, distant, respectful love, that she should ever be obliged
to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace, concealed in that bosom;
little did I dream that I should have lived to see such disasters fallen
upon her in a nation of gallant men, in a nation of men of honor, and of
cavaliers.

6. I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards,
to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult. But the age of
chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and calculators, has
succeeded: and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever. Never, never
more shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex, that proud
submission, that dignified obedience, that subordination of the heart,
which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the spirit of an exalted
freedom. The unbought grace of life, the cheap defense of nations, the
nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise, is gone! It is gone, that
sensibility of principle, that chastity of honor, which felt a stain
like a wound, which inspired courage, while it mitigated ferocity, which
ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice itself lost half its
evil, by losing all its grossness.

CVIII.—ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCH-YARD.

GRAY.

  Thomas Gray was born in London, December 26, 1716, and died in
  1771. The following poem has been always deservedly popular. The
  manuscript of it was sold in London in 1854 for £131.


  1. The curfew tolls the knell of parting day;
      The lowing herds wind slowly o’er the lea;
    The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
      And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

  2. Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
      And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
    Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
      And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;

  3. Save that, from yonder ivy-mantled tower,
      The moping owl does to the moon complain
    Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,
      Molest her ancient, solitary reign.

  4. Beneath those rugged elms, that ewe-tree’s shade,
      Where heaves the turf in many a moldering heap,
    Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,
      The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.

  5. The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,
      The swallow, twittering from the straw-built shed,
    The cock’s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
      No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.

  6. For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
      Or busy housewife ply her evening care;
    No children ran to lisp their sire’s return,
      Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.

  7. Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield;
      Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;
    How jocund[654] did they drive their team afield!
      How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!

  8. Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
      Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
    Nor Grandeur hear, with a disdainful smile,
      The short and simple annals of the poor.

  9. The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
      And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave,
    Await, alike, the inevitable[655] hour;—
      The paths of glory lead—but to the grave.

  10. Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,
      If memory o’er their tomb no trophies[656] raise,
    Where, through the long-drawn aisle, and fretted vault,
      The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.

  11. Can storied urn, or animated bust,
      Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
    Can Honor’s voice provoke the silent dust,
      Or Flattery soothe the dull, cold ear of death?

  12. Perhaps, in this neglected spot, is laid
      Some heart, once pregnant[657] with celestial fire;
    Hands, that the rod of empire might have swayed,
      Or waked to ecstasy[658] the living lyre.[659]

  13. But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,
      Rich with the spoils of time, did ne’er unroll;
    Chill Penury[660] repressed their noble rage,
      And froze the genial current of the soul.

  14. Full many a gem, of purest ray serene,
      The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear;
    Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
      And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

  15. Some village Hampden, that, with dauntless breast,
      The little tyrant of his fields withstood;
    Some mute, inglorious Milton here may rest;
      Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country’s blood.

  16. The applause of listening senates to command
      The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
    To scatter plenty o’er a smiling land,
      And read their history in a nation’s eyes.

  17. Their lot forbade; nor circumscribed[661] alone
      Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;
    Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,
      And shut the gates of mercy on mankind;

  18. The struggling pangs of conscious Truth to hide,
      To quench the blushes of ingenuous Shame;
    Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride
      With incense kindled at the muse’s flame.

  19. Far from the madding crowds ignoble strife,
      Their sober wishes never learned to stray:
    Along the cool, sequestered[662] vale of life,
      They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.

  20. Yet, even these bones from insult to protect,
      Some frail memorial, still erected nigh,
    With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture decked,
      Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

  21. Their name, their years, spelled by the unlettered Muse,
      The place of fame and elegy supply;
    And many a holy text around she strews,
      That teach the rustic moralist to die.

  22. For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,
      This pleasing, anxious being e’er resigned,—
    Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,—
      Nor cast one longing, lingering look behind?

  23. On some fond breast the parting soul relies;
      Some pious drops the closing eye requires:
    Even from the tomb the voice of nature cries,
      Even in our ashes live their wonted fires.

  24. For thee, who, mindful of the unhonored dead,
      Dost in these lines their artless tale relate,
    If, chance, by lonely Contemplation led,
      Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

  25. Haply, some hoary-headed swain may say,
      “Oft have we seen him, at the peep of dawn,
    Brushing, with hasty steps, the dews away,
      To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

  26. “There, at the foot of yonder nodding beech,
      That wreathes its old, fantastic roots so high,
    His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
      And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

  27. “Hard by yon wood, now smiling, as in scorn,
      Muttering his wayward fancies, he would rove;
    Now drooping, woful, wan, like one forlorn,
      Or crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love.

  28. “One morn I missed him on the accustomed hill,
      Along the heath, and near his favorite tree;
    Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
      Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he

  29. “The next, with dirges due, in sad array,
      Slow through the churchyard path we saw him borne—
    Approach, and read (for thou canst read), the lay,
      Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.”

  THE EPITAPH.

  30. “Here rests his head upon the lap of earth,
      A youth to fortune and to fame unknown;
    Fair Science frown’d not on his humble birth,
      And melancholy mark’d him for her own.

  31. “Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
      Heav’n did a recompense as largely send:
    He gave to mis’ry all he had—a tear;
      He gain’d from heaven (’twas all he wish’d) a friend.

  32. “No farther seek his merits to disclose,
      Or draw his frailties from their dread abode;
    (There they, alike, in trembling hope repose,)
      The bosom of his Father and his God.”

CIX.—THE VOLUNTARY CONFESSION OF SIN.

LACORDAIRE.


1. The most important of the divine penalties with which the Church is
armed is confession, voluntary[663] confession. And in that penalty there
is justice; for if you have had the courage to commit the fault, why not
do so before the world? If you have not been afraid of doing evil before
your own heart, why not do so before the whole human family?

2. And yet this justice is merciful; for it is not to the world, to a
severe and corrupt world, that you are directed to avow your faults, but
to a single man, in the most profound secret; to a man humble and meek,
subject to temptation like his brethren, but purified by victory; and
that avowal humbles without dishonoring you, touches rather than strikes
you, reconciles you to yourself and to God: to yourself by the good which
you feel living in your heart, to God by the pardon which he grants to
you.

3. When Protestants abolished[664] confession, when they sent men to
confess to God, what did they do? They only left the soul alone with sin,
and drove away mercy by the fear of justice. And when, gentlemen, by a
better instinct, you occupy yourselves about penitentiary[665] systems,
are you not upon the traces of Jesus Christ and His Church? Do you not
seek to transform public vengeance into expiation,[666] so that the
guilty might leave your hands punished but saved, wounded by shame and
grief but brought back by them to the sense and honor of virtue? It is
your object, and one of your most cherished desires, one also most worthy
of respect; why, then, do you despise the mystery of expiation in the
Church? Why do you not perceive that the work accomplished by her is the
very one which it is your ambition to realize? For you are as yet only
making experiments, and what experiments they are!

4. You may build very ingenious prisons, you may stifle a man well
between four walls, you may impose upon him many privations which you do
not consider to be tortures because they do not shed blood; but, whatever
you may do, you will always dishonor man, and you will find the road
to his heart only to pour into it more deeply the poison of despair.
Yes, penitence is more needed than penalties; expiation rather than
repression; rehabilitation[667] rather than death. Yes, but you cannot
effect this.

5. Think that this is accomplished; let men come to the feet of the
priest, and you will do more than with your chains, your executioners and
your dreams. Besides, what crimes do you extinguish with all this penal
preparation? Murder, theft, violence. But there exists an evil which
pierces men’s hearts, which gnaws the peace of families, which corrupts
nations, and delivers them over, bound hand and foot, to the first
conqueror who comes. Does not this evil escape from you? We, with our
voluntary confession, reach all public as well as secret crimes; we reach
them in the thought that prepares them, on the throne as well as in the
shop of the artizan. See these princes, who are men like ourselves, more
men than we, and on that account more to be pitied. They have their vices
surrounded with guards and honors; truth does not reach them even when
men are able to insult them, for insult teaches nothing.

6. Stand by a moment; behold a poor priest, a Capuchin, whose name is
unknown; he ascends the superb stairs, he enters, he penetrates even
where confidential friends are not admitted; he sits, and the prince,
kneeling, says to him, “_Confiteor tibi Pater_.” And to whom does he say
that? It is not to a man, but to the whole of humanity. It is the whole
human kind which seizes and compresses him, which says to him, “Sire, you
have sinned, you are not worthy to draw near to God.”

7. If some one had said to Augustus, whilst he was walking in his gardens
with Horace or Mecænas, “There is a man below with a staff and wallet,
who says he is sent from God to hear the confession of your faults;”
would he not have looked upon him as a madman? And yet, gentlemen, that
folly has prevailed! And observe, I pray you, that, on all occasions, in
Christianity we find nothing but follies; and we justify these follies
before you—you, the _élite_ of this age—and you listen to them and
exclaim, “Nevertheless it is grand!”
